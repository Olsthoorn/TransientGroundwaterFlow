      "Consider the graph of a circle. We will add radio buttons to change the radius of the circle. The code and an image of the interactive window are shown below.\n",
      "\n",
      "In *step 1* we create a figure, add an an axis, and add a circle to the axis. The circle object is stored as `c1`. The axis is created with the `axes` command, and the aspect ratio is set with the keyword argument `aspect='equal'` so that a circle looks like a circle and not an ellipse. Finally, the data limits of the axes are set. This is important as `matplotlib` won't do that for you when you add a patch. \n",
      "\n",
      "In *step 2* we create a second axis that will contain the radio buttons; the axis is called `rax`. The aspect ratio is again set to `'equal'` so that the buttons look like cirles (rather than ellipses), and the title of the axis is set to `Radius`.\n",
      "\n",
      "In *step 3* a `RadioButtons` object is created and called `radio`. The `RadioButtons` class takes two arguments: the axis to which the radio buttons are added (here it is `rax`), and a list with the labels of the buttons. We create three buttons with labels 1, 2, and 6. The labels need to be given as a list of strings. Two additional keyword arguments are provided: `active=1` tells the `RadioButtons` class that upon creation button number 1 is active (the first button is number *zero*) as the circle has a radius $R=2$ when we create it. The keyword argument `activecolor='r'` tells the `RadioButtons` class to use the color red for the active button. \n",
      "\n",
      "In *step 4* the function `setradius` is defined (we can choose whatever name we find appropriate). The function takes one argument, which is the label of one of the radio buttons. When the function is called, it sets the radius of circle `c1` to the value of the label of the radio button. Note that the label of the radio button is a string, so we have to convert it to a float first. The function ends by calling the `draw()` function that redraws the figure with a circle with the new radius. \n",
      "\n",
      "In *step 5*, the `radio` object is told that when one of the radio buttons is clicked it should call the `setradius` function. The `on_clicked` function is part of the `RadioButtons` class. \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, in *step 6* we call `show()` to show the figure.\n",
      "\n",

We will add a slider to the graph that allows the user to rotate the circle from -180$^\\circ$ to +180$^\\circ$. The proces consists again of the six steps defined at the top of this Notebook. In *step 1* we create the graph. The line is added as a Line2D class called `line1` and has only two points. The first point is $(x,y)=(-R\\cos(\\alpha),-R\\sin(\\alpha))$, the second point is $(x,y)=(R\\cos(\\alpha),R\\sin(\\alpha))$; initially the angle is $\\alpha=0$ and the radius is $R=3$. In *step 2* we create the axis to which we will add the slider. In *step 3* we create the slider and call it `angleslider`. The `Slider` class takes four input arguments: the axis to add the slider to, the name that is printed next to the slider, the minimum value and the maximum value. There are also a number of keyword arguments (use `Slider?` after you import it). We use one here: we set the initial value of the slider to zero using the `valinit` keyword. In *step 4* we define an update function `setangle` that will be called when the value of the slider is changed. It takes as argument the value of the slider, it changes the $x$ and $y$ data of the line, and it draws the updated figure. In *step 5* we tell the slider to call the `setangle` function when the value is changed using the `on_changed` function. And finally in *step 6* we show the figure. A still image of a more complicated version of this figure is shown below Exercise 4."
