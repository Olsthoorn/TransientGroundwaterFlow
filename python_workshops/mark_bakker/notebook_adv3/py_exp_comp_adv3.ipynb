      "###A Triangle Class\n",
      "So far, we have learned what is called *functional* programming. In functional programming you write or use functions that manipulate data. For example, consider the case where we have to deal with a number of triangles. For each triangle we want to be able to compute its area, and we want to be able to plot it an fill the inside with a color. Say we have an arbitrary number of $N$ triangles. For each triangle we need to store the $(x,y)$ values of its three corner points. So we create arrays for the $x$ values of each corner point, we create arrays for the $y$ values of each corner point. Then we write a function that computes the area of a triangle given its three corners, and we write a function that plots the triangle given the three corner points and color to fill the triangle, and we need to loop through all the corner points. This all sounds like a bit of work, but it is tracktable. It already gets more complicated when we want to change the corner point of one triangle. We have to know its place in the array, and change the correct corner point.\n",
      "\n",
      "It gets even more complicated when we have to deal with both triangles and rectangles. Triangles have three corner points, while rectangles have four corner points. The function to compute the area of a rectangle is very different, hence we have to make sure we call the area function for a triangle when we have a triangle, and the area function for a rectangle when we have a rectangle. The plotting is not much different, but we have to supply it four corner points rather than three. This gets a bit messier already. Wouldn't it be nice if it was possible to organize the data and functions in such a way that the data itself knows how to compute its area or how to plot itself? That may sound magical, but that is exactly what Object Oriented Programming does. \n",
      "\n",
      "Object oriented programming is, in essence, just another way of organizing your data and functions. Rather than defining and storing them separately, the data and functions are stored and bound together in what is called a *Class*. The data that are stored are called *attributes*, and the functions are called *methods*. \n",
      "This is probably easiest understood by writing a class and using it. Consider, for example, the class `Triangle` that stores the coordinates of the three corner points. Don't worry about the syntax yet, we will get back to that in a minute. Run the code below so we can start using the class. "

The location of the left, bottom, width, and height are specified height in relative coordinats (both the horizontal and vertical direction run from 0 to 1).

      "###Matplotlib patches\n",
      "The plotting package `matplotlib` includes a set of classes to define shapes, which are called *patches* in `matplotlib`. There are patches for many different shapes including circles, ellipses, polygons, wedges, and arrows. Here we learn how to draw these patches. We learn how to make them move interactively in a future notebook.\n",
      "\n",
      "The process for adding a patch to a graph is always the same. First you create an axis, then you create a patch object and add the patch object to the axis. Finally, when you are done, you call `show()`. Each patch object has a few input arguments and a number of keyword arguments. The keyword arguments include: `ec` for edge color, `fc` for face color, `alpha` for transparancy, and `zorder` for the order in which they are plotted, the patch with the highest `zorder` value lies on top. The names of all patch classes start with a capital: `Circle`, `Ellipse`, `Polygon`, `Wedge`, `Arrow`. You need to import these classes from `matplotlib.patches` to be able to use them. Use the help system to learn about the required input arguments. The graph below contains two circles, where the smaller one is on top of the larger one. The background color is set to the same color as the small circle, so that it looks like the large circle has a hole. The aspect ration of the axis is set to `'equal'` when the axis is created. The `autoscale` function needs to be called to set the limits of the axis such that the patches fit exatly in the axis. Alternatively, you can call the `ax.set_xlim` and `ax.set_ylim` functions to select limits that you may like better."
