Hence, it is more efficient to compute and store the inverse of the matrix rather than repeatedly calling the `np.linalg.solve` method. The inverse of a matrix may be computed with the `inv` function of the `linalg` package. If the inverse of matrix `A` is called `Ainv`, the solution for the pressure may be obtained through matrix multiplication of `Ainv` with the right-hand side. For example, for the first problem in this Notebook, fitting a parabola through three points, the inverse of the matrix can be computed to obtain a solution as follows: "

In a sparse matrix, only the value and location of non-zero values in a matrix are stored. Functionality for sparse matrices is available in the `scipy.sparse` package.
