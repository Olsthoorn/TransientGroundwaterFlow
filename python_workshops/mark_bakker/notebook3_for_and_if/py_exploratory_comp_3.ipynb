    "The file `oil_price.dat` contains the monthly oil price since 1985. The file contains three columns: year, month, price in Euros (from the european bank website). Make a plot of the oil price (put numbers along the horizontal axis; we will learn how to do dates in another notebook) and determine the month and year the oil price first rose above 40 euros, above 60 euros, and above 80 euros. You need to write to the screen something like `The oil price exceeds 40 euros for the first time in month xx of year yyyy` where `xx` and `yyyy` are the correct month and year. Use a double loop. Can you modify the code such that it doesn't print the number of the month but the name of the month?"
