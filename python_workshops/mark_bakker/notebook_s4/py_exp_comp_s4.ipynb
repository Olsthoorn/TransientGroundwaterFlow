      "###Linear regression\n",
      "We apply linear regression to fit a straight line through a set of data. The function `polyfit` fits a polynomial of arbitrary degree through a set of data (`polyfit` is part of the `numpy` package). The input arguments are `x,y,degree`. When the degree of the polynomial is 1, it fits a straight line of the form $y=p[0]*x+p[1]$ and it returns the array of parameters `p`. The parameters are obtained by `polyfit` by minimizing the sum of the squares of the errors between the data (the $y$-values) and the fitted polynomial. For example, consider the `xdata` and `ydata` below. The slope and $y$-intercept of the best-fit line are computed and both the data and best-fit line are drawn."

The two experiments don't give exactly the same value. You are asked to determine the linear relationship between the two measurements.
