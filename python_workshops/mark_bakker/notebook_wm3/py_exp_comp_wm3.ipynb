      "A water distribution system consists of multiple pipes that are connected in nodes. Consider a simple system consisting of two pipes. Pipe 1 starts in node $A$ and ends in node $B$ where it is connected to pipe 2. Pipe 2 starts at node $B$ and ends at node $C$. The pressure distribution along the two pipes is shown below. Water enters the system at node $A$, where the pressure is fixed to $p_A=40$ m (for example with a pump or water tower). The friction factor of both pipes is $f=0.02$; the lengths are $L_1=1000$ m, $L_2=2000$ m; the diameters are $D_1=380$ mm, $D_2=300$ mm. The outflow at node $C$ is $Q_C=200$ m$^3$/hour, while there is an additional $Q_B=100$ m$^3$/hour taken out at node B. From continuity of flow, this means that $Q_1=300$ m$^3$/hour and $Q_2=200$ m$^3$/hour. We are going to compute the pressure at nodes $B$ and $C$ and plot the pressure in nodes $A$, $B$, and $C$. We will store all variables in arrays and compute the pressure using a loop. This may look like overkill for a system with 2 pipes, but is necessary when there are many pipe segments.

      "A common approach to determine the flow and pressure distribution in a system with loops is the method developed by Hardy Cross. The method consists of 3 steps. First, make a guess at the water distribution in the system. Make sure that your guess meets continuity of flow. For example, for the case above, you could guess $Q_0=300$, $Q_1=300$, and $Q_2=100$ (note which direction is chosen positive in the figure). This guess meets continuity of flow, as $Q_0=Q_1$ (no water is taken out at node $B$), and $Q_1+Q_2=400$ ($400$ is taken out at node $C$). This guess is unlikely to produce the correct pressure drop: the pressure drop over the loop is likely not zero. In the second step of the approach, the discharges in the pipes are adjusted such that the pressure drop over the loop is zero while maintaining continuity of flow. This is done by adding a circular discharge $\\Delta Q$ to the system, as indicated in the figure. Note that the direction of $\\Delta Q$ is chosen counter clock wise. $\\Delta Q$ needs to be added to $Q_0$ and $Q_1$ (as it is positive in the same directions as $Q_0$ and $Q_1$, while it should be subtracted from $Q_2$ (as it is positive in the direction opposite to $Q_2$). For example, when $\\Delta Q = 50$, then $Q_0=350$, $Q_1=350$, and $Q_2=50$. Note that whatever the value of $\\Delta Q$, continuity is always met! "

      "Now that we have a function that computes the drop over the loop, we need to find the value of `delQ` that makes the pressure drop over the loop zero. We can apply the `fsolve` function to do that. The function fsolve is not magic, however. First of all, it doesn't guarantee to find a zero. Second, if the function has multiple points where the function equals zero, then the value that `fsolve` finds depends on the starting location. The function `pdrop_triangle` has two zeros, as you can see by plotting $\\Delta p$ vs. $\\Delta Q$. To avoid finding the wrong zero, we use a different function to find the zero of `pdrop_triangle`. The function is called `bisect` and implements what is called the *Bisection* method (much more on root-finding methods in Period 3). It requires the specification of two values of $\\Delta Q$ between which to search for a zero. In addition, for one of the search limits the `pdrop_triangle` function needs to be negative, while for the other value the `pdrop_triangle` needs to be positive. When looking at the values above, good limits seem to be `Q2`, in which case the flow in pipe 2 is zero and `-Q0`, in which case the flow in pipe 0 is zero. Use `help` to read more information on the `bisect` method.  "

      "An additional pipe is installed in the distribution system of Exercise 3, as shown in the figure below. Pipe 4 runs from node A to node C and is 2000 m long. The other properties are the same as for the other pipes. Water can now flow from Node A to Node C in three different ways. This redundancy is a good feature of a water distribution system, but it also makes it more complicated to compute the discharge in each pipe and the pressure in each node. To find a solution, we need to iterate between the two loops: solve for $\\Delta Q_1$ and adjust discharge estimates $Q_0$, $Q_1$, and $Q_4$ accordingly, solve for $\\Delta Q_2$ and adjust discharge estimates $Q_2$, $Q_3$, and $Q_4$ accoringly, then back to solve for $\\Delta Q_1$ and adjust discharge estimates $Q_0$, $Q_1$, and $Q_4$ accordingly, etc., until the solution converges. The solution has converged when the values of $\\Delta Q_1$ and $\\Delta Q_2$ approach zero, which means that the discharges in the pipes don't change anymore from iteration to iteration.

When the loop seems to work nicely and approach convergence, you can increase the number of times you do the loop (if you do it correctly and your initial guess isn't too far off, you will converge in only 5 or 6 iterations). Report the discharges in all pipes (in m$^3$/hour) and the pressure in node C. Does addition of the pipe from $A$ to $C$ have a big influence on the pressure in Node C?"
