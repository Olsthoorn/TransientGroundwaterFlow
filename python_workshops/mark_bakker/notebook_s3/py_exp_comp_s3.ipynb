In statistical terms, you are asked to perform a Hypothesis test, testing the null hypothesis that the mean is 40 against the alternative hypothesis that the mean is not 40 at significance level 5%. Hence, you are asked to do a two-sided $t$-test. All you can do in Hypothesis testing it trying to reject the null hypothesis, so let's try that. Most statistics books give a cookbook recipe for performing a $t$-test. Here we will visualize the $t$-test. We reject the null hypothesis if the sample mean is outside the 95% interval around the mean of the corresponding $t$-distribution. If the mean is inside the 95% interval we can only conclude that there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Draw the probability density function of a $t$-distribution with mean 40 and standard deviation equal to the standard deviation of the sample mean you computed above. Draw red vertical lines indicating the left and right limits of the 95% interval around the mean. Draw a heavy black vertical line at the position of the sample mean you computed above.
