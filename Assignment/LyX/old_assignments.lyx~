\begin_layout Section
Problem statement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a region to the right of a straight river which is in direct contact
 with a water table aquifer that has a transmissivity of 
\begin_inset Formula $kD=900\,\mathrm{m^{2}/d}$
\end_inset

 or an average saturated thickness of 
\begin_inset Formula $D=30\,\mathrm{m}$
\end_inset

 and a horizontal conductivity of 
\begin_inset Formula $k=30\,\mathrm{m/d}$
\end_inset

.
 The specific yield of the aquifer is 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{y}=10%\ensuremath{\%}
$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is regional groundwater flow directed towards that river at a rate
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $q=0\,\mathrm{m^{2}/d}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A groundwater pumping station with one well is installed at 
\begin_inset Formula $L=1500\,\mathrm{m}$
\end_inset

 distance from the river which starts extracting at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t=0$
\end_inset

 at a rate of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q=1200\,\mathrm{m^{3}/d}$
\end_inset

.
 For the analysis the aquifer thickness can be considered constant as given
 above.

 Wells along a river in a closed valley.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A groundwater extraction station with three wells is to be realized in a
 very long, 
\begin_inset Formula $L=5\,\mathrm{km}$
\end_inset

 wide, almost straight valley.
 The valley is bounded by bedrock while the sediments below the water table
 can be considered 
\begin_inset Formula $D=50\,\mathrm{m}$
\end_inset

 thick, layer of sand on top of pratically impervious material.
 As shown in the cross section of Figure 1, a river, that may be considered
 fully penetrating and in direct contact with the aquifer, flows along one
 of the valley walls.
 The water table is 5 m below ground surface at the center line of the valley,
 where the wells are to be installed.
 As is shown on the map in Figure 2, the three wells will be placed 500
 m apart along the center line of the valley.
 Each well will pump 
\begin_inset Formula $Q=2400\,\mathrm{m^{3}/d}$

\begin_layout Standard
One pumping well and three observation wells were installed first, and a
 pumping test was done on it to determine the aquifer properties, i.e.
 its transmissivity 
\begin_inset Formula $kD$
\end_inset

 and its storage coefficient, i.e.
 its specific yield 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{y}$
\end_inset

.
 The pumping lasted for 1 months (30 days) at a rate of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q=600\,\mathrm{m^{3}/d}$
\end_inset

.
 During this time, the heads in the well and in the piezometers were monitored
 from which the drawdown relative to the initial situation was determined.
 These darwdowns are provided in a table in an accompanying spreadsheet.
 The header of the table shows at which distance from this well the observation
 wells were placed.
 These observation wells (also called piezometers) are not shown on the
 cross section and the map because they are too close to the well to be
 shown on this scale.

\begin_layout Enumerate
Compute as a function of time the flow from the river into the groundwater
 system.
 It is assumed that the groundwater head is initially uniform and equal
 to the river stage (water level in the river).
 Do this for the averate flow during the 6 month of building pit operation
 (ignore the variation in the extraction for simplicity).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
How much time is required after stopping until about 90% of the drawdown
 has disappeared?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
After exactly 3 months, the water level in the river rises suddenly by 1
 m and stays so during one month, after which it suddenly returns to its
 original level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
To what extent does this wave affect the water level in the building pit
 if no measure is taken?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
What must be the extraction during this month to guarantee that the building
 pit fulfills the required 5 m drawdown relative to the original water level?
 If both effects do not overlap, say so, and explain what you could to as
 building-pit owner to better counteract the effect of the wave in the river
 stage on the head below the building pit
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If the river is influenced by sea tide, such that its level fluctuates twice
 a day between +1 and -1 m relative to the average value.
 How does this tide influence the required pumping? Is the location of the
 most critical point still the same?

 Water company uses ASR system to prevent extraction from tiver during summer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Problem statement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A water company extracts water from a small river to treat and distribute
 it as drinking water for the population of a small town nearby.
 This is not a problem in winter.
 However, due to growing demand for drinking water and growing environmental
 concern, extraction has become more and more problematic during summers
 when the discharge of this small river is at its lowest.
 The environmental agency has recently even forbidden to further extract
 water from the river during the summer months.

Situation sketch.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to solve the problem that this causes for the drinking water supply,
 the drinking water company has suggested an "Aquifer Storage and Recovery"
 system (these so-called ASR systems are becoming more and more popular).
 It wants to take in more river water during winter and inject it through
 a well (or wells) at some distance from the river into the local water-table
 aquifer, so that this water can be extracted during the next summer.
 This way, no water-intake will be necessary during the summer months.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, the debate that took off between the water company and the environmenta
l agency focuses on whether, or to what extent, this ASR system really makes
 sense.
 Can you really store the water in winter and extract it during summer without
 substantially affecting the already low summer-discharge of the river?
 Will not much of the stored water flow back to the river through the aquifer
 during winter? And would the extraction not induce an infiltration from
 the river into the aquifer during summer, so that there is still a water
 intake, the only differece now being that it will be invisible?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's your task as hydrologist of the environmental agency to answer this
 question and illustrate it quantitatively and also explain it clearly.
 Your explanation should include why and how you derived your answer.
 It should show the math and the code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is obvious that ASR will work if the distance between the well and the
 river is large enough.
 But how large is large enough, and on what does it depend? The water company
 suggested a distance of 500 m from the river.
 Should the environmental agency agree?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Hints and further information:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
To analyse this system, at least coarsely, simplify the injection and extraction
 regime and apply superposition.
 Superposition allows to only consider the well and treat the river as a
 fixed-head boundary using a mirror well.
 Simplify the river to a straight line along the y-axis and place the well
 at distance 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{w}$
\end_inset

 from this line at coordinate 
\begin_inset Formula $(x_{w},0)$
\end_inset

.
 That is, the x-axis is perpendicular to the river.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The drinking water demand, 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

, is considered constant year-round at 
\begin_inset Formula $150\,\mathrm{L/d}$
\end_inset

 per inhabitant for the 10000 inhabitants of the town.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Assume the following injection and recovery regime:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The water company well extracts during 3 summer months (June, July, Aug)
 its full demand
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
It compensates that during 6 winter months (October-March) by injecting
 half its daily capacity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
There is neither injection nor extraction during the months April, May and
 September.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The idea is to analyse this ASR system by computing the exchange between
 the aquifer and the river due to the well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
When you have coded the problem for this particular distance of 500 m, experimen
t with this distance to come up with a distance that realy makes sense in
 terms of not inducing loss of river water during the summer months.
 That is, try 1000 and 2000 m.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Use 
\begin_inset Formula $kD=900\,\mathrm{m^{2}/d}$

, 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{y}=0.2$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Steps to take:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Use Theis' well function to compute drawdowns:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s(t,t)=\frac{Q}{4\pi kD}\mathrm{W}(u)\mbox{, with }\mathrm{W}(u)=-scipy.special.expi(-u)\mbox{ and }u=\frac{r^{2}S}{4kDt}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
From Theis' well function
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathrm{W}(u)=\intop_{u}^{\infty}\frac{e^{-y}}{y}dy
\]

\end_inset

derive the flow 
\begin_inset Formula $Q(r,t)\,\mathrm{[L^{3}/T]}$
\end_inset

 and the specific discharge 
\begin_inset Formula $q(r,t)\,\mathrm{[L^{2}/T]}$
\end_inset

 in the aquifer at distance 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 from the well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
To simulate the river, apply a mirror well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Compute the exchange between aquifer and river, derive the specific discharge
 
\begin_inset Formula $q\,\mathrm{[L^{2}/T]}$
\end_inset

 perpendicular to the river at an arbitrary point 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Compute this specific discharge for a large number of points between 
\begin_inset Formula $-ax_{w}<y<ax_{w}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 is sufficiently large, thus covering a large enough track of the river
 to capture about the full induced exchange between aquifer and the river.
 See below how appropriate 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

-coordinates can be generated in Python.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Numerically integrate this specific discharge along the river to obtain
 the total exchange between river and aquifer.
 (Numerical integration is easy when uing the Simpson's trampezium rule).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Having the code to do this for a single time, it can readily be extended
 for a large number of times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Check that for large times, the total flow between aquifer and river should
 be about the total discharge of the well if the well is continuously injecting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Finally simulate the actual flow regime with 6 month injection and 3 months
 extraction as explained above.
 Simulate for a period of 5 years.
 This simulation requires superposition in time.

\begin_layout Chapter
Assignment Jan 2016.
 Several exercises based on the syllabus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the last assignment using Excel.
 Later ones all used Python (Jupyter notebooks), which are much more powerfull
 for this kind of work and also freely available, where Excel is not.
 The workout in Excel is availale.
 Here we will use Python.

Setup
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assignments are to be done in Excel, but those who want, can do them in
 Python; we’ll stick to Excel in class.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I want you to explain why you took this and that step.
 The essence is that you show that you understand what is at stake; the
 exact numerical answer is less important.
 Clearly, everybody should workout his/her own assignment.
 The assignment is split into 7 parts.
 Each can be done on a single worksheet, hence all can be joined in a single
 Jupyter notebook.

Pumping test Dalem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a pumping test similar to the one called “Dalem” described in Kruseman
 and De Ridder (1994).
 The situation is shown in the figure below.
 The data are given in the workbook “DataPumptest.xls”.
 It is not known beforehand whether the groundwater system is semi-confined,
 confined are unconfined and whether the drawdown shows delayed yield.
 The student should find out him/herself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each student obtains a different data set that consists of the drawdown
 for three monitoring wells each at a different distance and direction from
 the well.
 The monitoring wells are in the same aquifer as the extraction well.
 The well discharge 
\begin_inset Formula $Q=760\,\mathrm{m^{3}/d}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is the student’s task work out this pumping test in the classical way,
 using double log charge of both the well functions and the drawdown and
 determine transmissivity, storage coefficient and possibly the spreading
 length, resistance of the cover layer and a second storage coefficient.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hint: Use the implementation of the Theis and Hantush function, then compute
 the type curves.
 Then make a double log chart of your data and fit them on the type curves.
 Judge whether the fit shows a pureTheis behavior or rather follows that
 of the Hantush type curves.
 Estimate the parameters.
 Finally see if there is any sign of delayed yield.
 If so, then also determine the second storage coefficient.
