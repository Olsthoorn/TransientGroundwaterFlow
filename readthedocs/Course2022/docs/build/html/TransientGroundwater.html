<p>This syllabus has been prepared as part of the IHE master’s program in Hydrology and Water Resources, at IHE Delft, The Netherlands. The part given by the author, i.e. transient analytical solutions, consists of a total of 18 lecture hours divided over four and a have days. The majority of ours will be oral lectures and a minority will be practical exercises in which the students learn to solve their problems by implementing the groundwater solutions in Python.</p>
<p>The material for this course will be stored on <strong>Github</strong> (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com">https://github.com</a>). Search for <em>Theo Olsthoorn</em> combined with <em>github</em> and or <em>TransientGroundwater</em> to find the site an or pictures of me. The material includes <em>Jupyter notebooks</em> that were used to generate most of the figures in this syllabus.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">2.2. </span>Note with respect to the exercises<a class="headerlink" href="#note-with-respect-to-the-exercises" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>Today, there are two skills that students should acquire: Python and QGIS.</p>
<p>With Python, there is no limit to what you as student of professional may compute (and visualize) on your laptop,. Neither is there any practical limit to the amount of data you can handle and process, or the complexity you can handle. And, perhaps the best of it: it is free of charge.</p>
<p>With QGIS there is no limit to the spatial data you can handle, analyze and process. And it is also free of charge.</p>
<p>With these two tools you equip yourself for the future as an engineer or scientist. Both Python and QGIS are free, which is a unique feature of our time. Never before was so much computing power available to everybody. And, nobody can ever take it from you, just because it’s free, always present for you to exploit it on your own laptop. Therefore, it is only up to you yourself to acquire the skills to use it. To help you, there is an immense amount of resources and information on the internet about both these tools, so you should never be without an answer to your questions. There are also numerous tutorials on the Internet, both written and on video, and, of course, there exists a large pile of books. Python and QGIS, which have been widely around for only about 1.5 decades, have already changed the world for engineers and scientists and are continuing to do so every day. So if you don’t want to be left behind, pick it up. My advice to you, dear students, is to start using both Python and QGIS for all your projects from now on.</p>
<p>The exercises for this course will be done in IPython notebooks (now called <em>Jupyter notebooks</em>), which are a terrific means to communicate your work with others, including your teachers. These notebooks, which were originally developed for Python only, have since a few years been extended to over 47 other computer languages, like <em>R</em> and <em>Julia</em>. That is why the name was changed from IPython notebooks to <em>Jupyter</em> notebooks. These notebooks allow you to combine, text, formulas and code, neatly formatted, while computations are done and visualized within the notebook itself. Therefore, if your notebook is correct, then your work is correct. And because the text, with formulas, code and graphical results can be nicely formatted within the notebook, the notebook is also a great means for sharing your results as a living document or, if you like, as a pdf document, which you can send to your teacher if he/she does not have or know Python.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>To convince yourselves read what Nature (world’s most famous scientific journal) said about <em>Ipython notebooks</em> in 2014:</p></li>

<h1><span class="section-number">3. </span>Introduction to transient phenomena in groundwater<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-to-transient-phenomena-in-groundwater" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h1>
<p>Transient phenomena can only occur if there is some form of storage for water under pressure. Without storage, at least theoretically, all changes of water pressures would spread out with infinite speed across the entire medium. The studied system would then always be in steady state. Clearly, this is never the case in physical reality. Every groundwater system has ways to store and release water under changes of pressure. The specific change of water volume in the porous medium per unit change of pressure (or head) determines the transient behavior of the groundwater system.</p>
<p>Under confined groundwater-flow conditions, part of the storage comes from compressibility of the porous medium and part from the compressibility of the water. Under conditions of a free water table, i.e. under unconfined flow conditions, meaning when a free water table is present, also called phreatic groundwater, most storage comes from filling and emptying pores above the water table and only a minor part from elastic storage. The elastic storage is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the phreatic storage. Because of this, elastic storage is mostly neglected for aquifer systems with a free water table.</p>
<p>Groundwater systems can be very slow and very fast. Whether a groundwater system is slow of fast depends on factors that we will study later in <a class="reference internal" href="#subsec-long-term-drainage-behavior-drainage"><span class="std std-ref">Long-term drainage behavior, characteristic drainage time</span></a>. An example of a very slow groundwater system, one that takes tens of thousands of years to reach equilibrium, is presented in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-gradual-decay-of-of-mound-kalahari-devries1984"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 1</span></a>, which shows the ongoing decay of the groundwater mound in the Kalahari Desert since the last wet episode, which happened some 12500 years ago (Vries 1984).

<p>Dynamics of groundwater may also be divided into <strong>reversible</strong> and <strong>irreversible</strong> behavior. In this syllabus, we will deal with reversible systems only. Forms of irreversible storage may nevertheless be important under specific circumstances, or may even be quite common. Therefore, we will start with an illustration of some forms of irreversible transient behavior of water-filled porous media.</p>

<section id="consolidation">
<h2><span class="section-number">4.1. </span>Consolidation<a class="headerlink" href="#consolidation" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>One possible form of volume change is due to reordering of ground particles, which may happen due to an increase of the effective pressure (= grain pressure), and is characterized by the squeezing out water which leads to an irreversible decline of pore space. This phenomenon is called consolidation and leads to land subsidence. The effective stress, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma_{e}\)</span>, is the pressure transmitted between the grains. Consolidation is especially well known for clay. In clay, under increased effective stress, micrometer-scale clay plates get reordered and the pore space thus becomes irreversibly smaller.</p>
<p>As long as grain stresses on vertical planes are horizontal, as is the case in undisturbed horizontal sediments, the total vertical stress, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma_{z}\)</span>, (in following chapters we will often use the symbol <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span> instead of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma_{e}\)</span>, but they are the same), working on a horizontal plane in the subsoil always equals the total weight above this plane. This weight includes possible loads on ground surface. The total vertical stress <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma_{z}\)</span> itself is the sum of the water pressure, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma_{w}\)</span>, and the effective vertical stress <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma_{e}\)</span></p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\sigma_{z}=\sigma_{w}+\sigma_{e}\]</div>
<p>If we increase the vertical stress, for instance by loading the surface with a layer of sand, or by filling a surface reservoir, or due to rainwater infiltrating during the winter season, both stresses will change</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\Delta\sigma_{z}=\Delta\sigma_{w}+\Delta\sigma_{e}\]</div>
<p>If the water pressure changes, while the total weight remains constant, as is the case when we lower the head in a confined aquifer (reflect on why this must be so?), then the water pressure and the effective stress are directly related</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
0 &amp; = &amp; \Delta\sigma_{w}+\Delta\sigma_{e}\\
\Delta\sigma_{w} &amp; = &amp; -\Delta\sigma_{e}\end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Therefore, if we lower the head, i.e. the water pressure, the effective stress increases and the water pressure decreases. This works the other way around in case the head were increased instead of lowered.</p>
<p>It follows that the lowering of the water pressure puts the grains of the porous medium under higher stress, which may, therefore, lead to (irreversible) subsidence in vulnerable soils.</p>
<p>An increased effective stress causes a reduction of the volume of the porous medium and, therefore, also of its pore space. To compensate for this reduced space, water will be squeezed out. The speed at which this happens depends on the conductivity of the compressed layer as well as its thickness, as with thicker layers it takes more time for the compressed water to reach the top or bottom of the layer, from which the water could escape.</p>
<p>Large-scale groundwater extractions have, therefore, led to large subsidences affecting large areas in, among others, Mexico, USA and the UK (<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-subsidence-in-the-uk"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 3</span></a>).</p>

<p>Subsidence can be relatively fast (happening within weeks) or slow (taking place over centuries) on local to regional scales.</p>
<p>Subsidence also occurs as a result of drainage of wetlands and peat areas. Peat means organic soil, which can decay. This lowering of the shallow water table also increases the effective stress as we saw above. This subsidence is especially evident in a low country like the Netherlands, where drainage of wetlands by ditches has taken place for about thousand years.</p>
<p>With regard to organic soils, called peat, it is not only the increase of the effective stress caused by drainage that causes the subsidence. It is also the entry of oxygen that can enter peaty soils when they are drained. This oxygen causes oxidation (a kind of natural <em>burning</em>) of the peat, giving an extra boost to the subsidence. Subsidence caused by oxidation may continue until it all peat has disappeared!</p>
<p>The peaty areas in the west and north of the Netherlands have thus subsided several meters (<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-rising-sea-level-and-subsidence-in-the-netherlands"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 4</span></a>). This is why about half the Netherlands lies nowadays below sea level.</p>
<p>In case the original soil layers consisted of alternations of peat and clay, as they often do, the shallow subsoil will consist more and more of pure clay at the top where all peat was burnt away by oxidation, with the original mixture still present below the water table. This clay layer at the top is the collection of all the clay that was present in the original profile, which may have been several meters thick.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">4.2. </span>Liquefaction<a class="headerlink" href="#liquefaction" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>Another irreversible phenomenon involving reordering of grains, is known as liquefaction, which can happen very fast and spectacularly. Liquefaction is associated with pressure waves, or shocks. Fine sand may have been at rest for thousands of years, even with its pore space being greater than according to the most dense packing of the grains. In the case of a shock, for instance due to an earthquake, the sudden change of water pressure may be so great as to cause the effective stress to be zero for a fraction of a second, during which the grains lose their mutual friction. The ground then loses its internal friction and momentarily turns into a quicksand. In fact, it suddenly becomes a dense liquid in which grains float as freely moving particles. The matrix will resettle within minutes at a smaller overall volume. During this resettling, the pore water no longer fits between the grains in their denser packing. As soon as the surplus water has escaped the soil resettles and everything sunk into the heavy liquid is stuck forever (see <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-liquefaction-in-alaska-1964"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 5</span></a>).</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">4.3. </span>Intrusion of salt water<a class="headerlink" href="#intrusion-of-salt-water" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>In many regions, especially deltaic regions, fresh groundwater floats on saline water, which is heavier (denser) than fresh water. (The difference in density between fresh and ocean water is about 2.5%). The fresh groundwater in the Netherlands is largely floating on salt water as is shown in the cross section in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-dynamically-floating-fresh-water-in-the-netherlands-cross-section"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 6</span></a>. It will generally take several hundred years to a thousand years for a freshwater lens to build up from natural precipitation. The equilibrium may easily be disturbed by extraction of fresh water, but also by construction of harbors, canals and polders. This will cause upconing of salt water from below and lateral intrusion of salt water into aquifers along the coast. Given the time it takes to restore such systems under natural conditions, mining of these systems may be considered irreversible under many practical situations as there are no real means (or sufficient fresh water) to restore the systems within the time horizon of a generation. Good groundwater management is, therefore, essential, but hard to realize in situations of water scarcity.</p>

<h1><span class="section-number">5. </span>Reversible groundwater storage<a class="headerlink" href="#reversible-groundwater-storage" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h1>
<p>In the remainder of this syllabus, we will restrict ourselves to reversible groundwater storage phenomena, i.e. phenomena in which the porous medium is not changed.</p>
<p>In groundwater flow systems, three separate forms of storage may be distinguished:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Phreatic storage, which occurs in unconfined aquifers, i.e. aquifers with a free water table. It is due to filling and emptying of pores at the top of the saturated zone.</p></li>
<li><p>Elastic storage, which is due to combined compressibility of the water, the grains and the porous matrix (soil skeleton). This storage releases or stores water wherever the pressure changes.</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes, the interface between fresh water and another fluid (be it saline water, oil or gas) can provide a third type of storage. This works by displacement of the interface, generally between the fresh water and the saline water. When displacing an interface, the total volume of water in the subsurface remains essentially the same, however, the amount of usable fresh water may increase (or decrease) at the cost of saline water, and therefore, one may consider this storage of fresh water.</p></li>
</ol>
<section id="phreatic-storage-water-table-storage-specific-yield-sy">
<h2><span class="section-number">5.1. </span>Phreatic storage (water table storage, specific yield, Sy)<a class="headerlink" href="#phreatic-storage-water-table-storage-specific-yield-sy" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>Phreatic storage is due to the filling and emptying of pores above the saturated zone, i.e. above the water table. Because it is related to changes of the water table, it is limited to phreatic (unconfined) aquifers.</p>
<p>The storage coefficient for an unconfined aquifer is called specific yield and is denoted by the symbol <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S_{y}\)</span>. It is dimensionless, as follows from its definition</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-eq-specific-yield-def">
<span class="eqno">(1)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-eq-specific-yield-def" title="Permalink to this equation"></a></span>\[S_{y}=\frac{\partial V_{w}}{\partial h}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\partial V_{w}\)</span> is the change of volume of water from a column of aquifer per unit of surface area and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\partial h\)</span> is the change of the water table elevation.</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S_{y}\)</span>, therefore, is the amount of water released from storage per square meter of aquifer per m drawdown of the water table.</p>
<p>Hydrogeologists, and groundwater engineers alike, often treat specific yield as a constant. In reality, the draining and filling of pores is more complex and this should be kept in mind in order to judge differences of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S_{y}\)</span> values under different circumstances even with the same aquifer material. This will be explained further down.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as a sharp boundary between the saturated and the unsaturated porous medium above and below the water table. In fact, the water content is continuous across the water table.</p>
<p><strong>The water table is, by definition, the elevation where the pressure equals atmospheric pressure.</strong></p>
<p>Because we relate all pressures relative to atmospheric, we may say the water table is the elevation where the water pressure is zero (relative to the pressure of the atmosphere).</p>
<p>The simplest conceptual model for the zone above the water table is a vertical straw or radius <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span> standing with its open end in water. Due to adhesion between the water and the straw, the water level will be sucked upward in the straw against gravity, thereby reaching an equilibrium height <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h\)</span> as shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-straw-of-radius-r"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 7</span></a>.</p>
<p>The soil itself may be considered to consist of a dense network of connected tortuous pores of small but widely varying diameter that may be fully or partially filled with water. Due to adhesive forces, pores may even be fully filled above the water table.</p>
<p><em>In pores above the water table the pressure is negative (i.e. below atmospheric).</em></p>
<p>If grains can be wetted (attract water), as is generally the case with water, water will be sucked against gravity, into the pores above the water table over a certain height. This height mainly depends on the diameter of the pores.</p>
<p>One can immediately compute the equilibrium of the water in the pore. We have gravity pulling down the water column reaching above the water table, and we have the cohesion force. Hence,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\rho gh\pi r^{2}=2\pi r\gamma\cos\left(\alpha\right)\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho\)</span> [kg/m <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^{3}\)</span>] is the density of water, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(g\)</span> [N/kg] is gravity, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gamma\)</span> [N/m <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^{2}\)</span>] is the cohesion stress, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha\)</span> the angle between the cohesion stress and the vertical. Hence,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[h=\frac{2\gamma}{\rho gr}\cos\left(\alpha\right)\]</div>
<p>which shows that the suction height <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h\)</span> is proportional to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1/r\)</span>, the inverse radius of the straw.</p>
<p>In practical situations, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha\)</span> is small so that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gamma\cos\alpha\approx\gamma\)</span>. As <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gamma\)</span> points is in the direction of the surface tension <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau\)</span> (see <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-straw-of-radius-r"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 7</span></a>) where the water surface meets the wall of the straw, we also have</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\tau\approx\gamma\]</div>
<p>with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau\)</span> the surface tension of the water surface, which equals <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau=75\times10^{-3}\mathrm{N/m}\)</span>, see any physical handbook or look it up on Wikipedia. Therefore, we can compute the suction head <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h\)</span> immediately given a pore radius.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{aligned}
h &amp; \approx &amp; \frac{2\tau}{\rho gr}\end{aligned}\]</div>
<p>Numerically,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}

<p>If we express <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span> in mm, (using <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h^{*}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r^{*}\)</span> to indicate mm), we get</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[h^{*}=\frac{15}{r^{*}}\]</div>
<p>This implies that water in a pore of 1 mm radius may be sucked up over about 15 mm, and water in a pore with a radius of 0.1 mm over 15 cm and water in a pore with a radius of 0.01 mm radius over 1.5 m. In reality, the suction may be 50% smaller because of the angle <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha\)</span> that was ignored here.</p>

This implies that the line of filled pores will not be sharp. Therefore, the saturation above the water table will gradually decline as shown in the right-hand figure .</p>
<p>The diameter of the widest pores will determine the height fully saturated above the water table, i.e. the thickness of the so-called capillary fringe. In gravel, the capillary fringe will be almost zero, but it may be several decimeters or even meters thick in fine-grained materials such as fine sand, loess, loam and clay. In sands, the capillary zone is usually 15-30 cm thick, depending on the grain size. The thickness of the capillary zone is sometimes visible as a wet zone in the banks of surface water. Note that all water above the water table is under negative pressure.</p>

<p>When the water table is lowered, for instance in a column of sand, and we measure the amount of water drained over time, we see that drainage is not immediate (<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-drainage-of-water-from-column-after-lowering-water-table"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 9</span></a>). After a couple of days, the drainage rate becomes negligibly small. We may thus call the amount drained during a couple of days the specific yield. It is immediately obvious that specific yield is not a unique physical parameter. The more time we take, the higher the specific yield becomes. It implies that the duration of the test determines the value to some extent. It also implies that a specific yield, when determined from a pumping test of a couple of days duration, is likely to be smaller than that determined from the seasonal fluctuation of the water table.</p>
<p>While the amount of water drained from the subsurface due to lowering of the water table is called <em>specific yield</em>, the amount retained is the soil is called the <em>specific retention</em>. Together they add up to the soil’s porosity (<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-relation-between-porosity-specific-yield-and-retention"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 10</span></a>). <em>Specific retention</em> is essentially the same as the so-called <em>field capacity</em>, i.e. the amount of water the soil can hold against gravity. It is defined is the amount of water retained in an originally saturated soil sample after a few days of free drainage at a suction head of about 200 cm.</p>

<p>The porosity of porous materials varies, but that of sands is often about 35%. Fine sands tend to have somewhat higher values, while coarse sands tend to have somewhat lower porosities (see <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-relation-between-porosity-specific-yield-and-retention"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 10</span></a>). This is related to the ease of compaction at the original time of sedimentation. Smaller grains have a higher surface area and are, therefore, more difficult to compact. In natural gravels, the pore space is often filled by finer grains. This reduces the porosity further. <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-relation-between-porosity-specific-yield-and-retention"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 10</span></a> shows that for very fine sands, the specific yield declines despite the higher porosity. This is mainly due to the higher specific retention (field capacity) of the finer-grained materials (<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-moisture-content-versus-pressure-head"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 11</span></a>) as well as to the lower hydraulic conductivity of such fine materials, and, therefore, further reduces their specific yield.</p>

<p>The behavior of water in the unsaturated zone is determined largely by the soil’s moisture retention curve of which a number is sketched in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-moisture-content-versus-pressure-head"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 11</span></a> (For the moisture retention curves of the Dutch soils see (Wösten, Veerman, and Stolte 1994).</p>

Therefore, in the case of perfect equilibrium between suction and gravity, the moisture characteristic curves represent the moisture content in the soil above the water table. The moisture content at 200 cm suction is generally taken as the field capacity. For sandy soils, the moisture content at this suction head is a good measure of the amount of water the soil can hold against gravity under free drainage conditions.</p>
<p>This implies that the moisture content depends on the distance to the water table (i.e. the suction). Hence, the ground surface above a shallow water table tends to be wetter than above a deep water table under otherwise the same circumstances. This must influence the specific yield as illustrated in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-influence-of-depth-and-time-on-specific-yield"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 12</span></a>.</p>

<p>When the water table is lowered, the entire moisture retention curve is lowered as is shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-influence-of-depth-and-time-on-specific-yield"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 12</span></a>-a. The specific yield times the difference of the two water tables equals the water from the hatched area times. It demonstrates that the entire unsaturated profile is involved in the specific yield. As already mentioned and shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-influence-of-depth-and-time-on-specific-yield"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 12</span></a>-c, specific yield increases with available drainage time.</p>
<p>If the water table is shallow (and the soil material is fine), a major part of <em>the moisture retention curve</em> will be cut off at ground surface as is shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-influence-of-depth-and-time-on-specific-yield"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 12</span></a>-b. Lowering of the water table will thus miss a portion of the hatched area of <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-influence-of-depth-and-time-on-specific-yield"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 12</span></a>-a. Therefore, the specific yield is smaller the shallower the water table is. This is also shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-influence-of-depth-and-time-on-specific-yield"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 12</span></a>-c.</p>
<p>We should thus not be surprised to find that the same fine dune sand may have a specific yield of 22% inside a large dune area, where the water table is usually several meters below ground surface, and only 8% in an adjacent flower bulb field with the same sand, but with a water table of only 60 cm below ground surface.</p>
<p>Soil characteristics may vary between wide limits. Generally, the coarser the soil, the thinner the capillary fringe (see <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-moisture-content-versus-pressure-head"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 11</span></a>). A complication is that the moisture characteristic curves differ during wetting and drying. This phenomenon is called hysteresis, but this is beyond this course.</p>
<p>Groundwater hydrologists dealing with saturated groundwater usually just use a single constant value for the specific yield in their formulas and models. The specific yield can be estimated from the soil in question, from moisture characteristic curves, in the laboratory, from field measurements, from pumping tests or groundwater-model calibration.</p>
<p>Even though this approach may seem doubtful or just wrong in the eyes of some, using a constant but appropriately chosen specific yield works remarkably well in practice. It is more a matter of realizing oneself when a constant specific yield of a certain value is not applicable. The above outline is meant as a help in deciding on this and to consciousness about what is behind this“simple” hydrologic parameter that we denote by the symbol <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S_{y}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Some groundwater models, like MODFLOW, have an option to vary specific yield automatically with water-table depth.</p>

<p>By sensitive continuous measurements of the phreatic head, daily variations in evapotranspiration can be often determined. While in the past the groundwater head could be gauged continuously on paper only, modern head loggers may register the head at short regular intervals and store large amounts of data internally for later use. With such instruments, accurate data become widely available and allow more detailed views on phenomena to be studied and analyzed. Such measurements are already known from Todd (1959) also printed in Todd and Mays (2005). <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-water-table-fluctuation-due-to-evapotranspiration"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 13</span></a> shows the daily fluctuation of the water table due to daily evapotranspiration measured more than sixty years ago.

<p>If the specific yield is known, evapotranspiration rates can sometimes be determined from such water-table registration.

So if one plots the derivative of the water table in a point versus time, it may be split into a more or less constant (long-term) trend and a the remainder due to short-term (daily) variation. If this short-term variation can be attributed to evapotranspiration from the water table, as it obviously is the case in the figure , one may determine it by taking the surface area between the measured head curve and its long-term trend, multiplied by the specific yield (hatched surface in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-determining-the-evapotranspiration-from-water-table-response"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 14</span></a>[fig:water-table-fluctuation-due-to-evapotranspiration-1]).</p>

<p>Till now, we only considered storage at the water table and gave very simple, but practical examples largely ignoring spatial dimensions. Spatial dimensions will be dealt with later. In this section, we handle the physics of elastic storage and will give some interesting everyday examples that are sometimes easily overlooked.</p>
<p>Elastic storage is the only storage occurring in confined and semi-confined aquifers, i.e. in aquifers without a water table, meaning aquifers that are completely filled with water from floor to ceiling. In such aquifers, we have no lowering of the water table whatsoever, unless the head is lowered to beneath the ceiling of the aquifer, a case further ignored here.</p>
<p>Therefore, in confined aquifer storage can only result from compression of the water and depression of the aquifer. The compressibility of the water and the grains themselves is quite obvious, but often the less obvious storage is the most important part. This is the deformation of the soil skeleton, the bulk matrix or the (bulk) porous medium as it is called.</p>

<section id="loading-efficiency">
<h3><span class="section-number">5.2.2. </span>Loading efficiency<a class="headerlink" href="#loading-efficiency" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>To analyze the physics of elastic storage, we start with noting that the total load at any depth is carried by the total (vertical pressure) <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma_{z}\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\,\mathrm{N/m^{2}}\)</span>. This total pressure must equal the sum of the vertical grain pressure (the so-called effective stress, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma_{e}\)</span>) and the water pressure <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma_{w}\)</span></p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[p=\sigma_{e}+\sigma_{w}\]</div>
<p>This is indicated in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-the-weight-of-ground-supported-by-sigmaw-sigmae"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 15</span></a>. The brown horizontal beams and the springs in this figure are imaginary; they replace the volume <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_{0}\)</span> ( <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1\mathrm{m^{3}}\)</span> say) that has been cut out of the aquifer. The two imaginary springs have the same properties as the water and the porous medium respectively. Let us see what happens when the pressure is increased by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta p\)</span>.</p>
<p>In that case, the volume (or height) <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_{0}\)</span> is reduced by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta V\)</span> and the springs pressures are increased by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta\sigma_{w}\)</span>and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta\sigma_{e}\)</span> respectively. The springs have a different stiffness, so <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta\sigma_{w}\ne\Delta\sigma_{e}\)</span>. However, each string will always carry a fixed proportion of the total stress. Therefore, we may write</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\Delta\sigma_{w}=LE\,\Delta p\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(LE\)</span> is this fixed proportion and is called the <em>loading efficiency</em>. The <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(LE\)</span> must obviously lie between <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0\)</span> and 1 and is fixed for any particular porous medium. So if we put a weight, like a layer of sand, on ground surface, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span> in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-the-weight-of-ground-supported-by-sigmaw-sigmae"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 15</span></a> will increase by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta p\)</span>, a change that is equal to the weight of the layer of sand per <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathrm{m}^{2}\)</span> placed on ground surface. We may then say <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta\sigma_{w}=LE\,\Delta p\)</span>, where the loading efficiency <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(LE\)</span> is a fixed number between 0 and 1, specific to a aquifer in question. If we have a piezometer in the aquifer, we’ll notice that the water level (hence, the head) has risen by placing the sand on ground surface. The head rise is given by</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\Delta\phi=\frac{LE}{\rho g}\Delta p\]</div>
<p>Now assume that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta p\)</span> is not due to a layer of sand placed on ground surface, but due to a change of the barometer pressure as in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-le-be-barometer"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 17</span></a>. Then the same reasoning applies, because the subsoil cannot know the difference between a pressure change due to a layer of sand placed on ground surface or due to an equivalent rise of the barometer pressue.</p>

<p>A nice and famous early example of loading efficiency is the impact of a train stopping at a station and leaving again some time later (<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-toddstrain"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 16</span></a>). The weight of the locomotive compresses the aquifer a bit, thus reducing its pore space. This in turn compresses the groundwater, which cannot readily escape. Hence, its pressure rises and it starts to flow sidewards, so that the pressure gradually decreases towards its original trend. When the train leaves, the opposite occurs. The removal of the load reduces the effective stress, which causes the aquifer to bounce back, providing more pore space to the water, which depressurizes and increases somewhat in volume. This reduced water pressure causes surrounding groundwater to flow inward to fill up the gap due to which the pressure gradually normalizes.</p>

<p>As said above, for the pressure in the aquifer there is no difference between the two pictures. However, there is a difference between the head (i.e. the water level) in the piezometer in the left picture and in that of the right picture. When placing a layer of sand on ground surface, the pressure on the water surface in the piezometer does not change. However, when the the barometer pressure changes, the pressure on the water surface in the piezometer does change. That change is, of course, exactly equal to the change of the barometer pressure. To see how the head changes due to a change of the barometer pressure let us just write out the water pressure at the bottom of the piezometer. It is clear that this pressure changes due to the change at ground surface such that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta a=\Delta p\)</span>, with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta a\)</span> the change of the barometer pressure.</p>
<p>Now assume that the head (i.e. the water level) in the piezometer changes by an amount <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta\phi\)</span>. The change of the water pressure at the bottom of the piezometer then is</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\Delta\sigma_{w}=\rho g\Delta\phi+\Delta a\]</div>
<p>But we already know the change of the water pressure</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\Delta\sigma_{w}=LE\,\Delta a\]</div>
<p>Hence,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\rho g\Delta\phi+\Delta a=LE\,\Delta a\]</div>
<p>and so</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
\rho g\Delta\phi &amp; =-(1-LE)\,\Delta a\\
 &amp; =-BE\,\Delta a\end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1-LE\)</span> is called the <em>barometer efficiency</em>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(BE\)</span>. Just like the loading efficiency, the barometer efficiency varies between 0 and 1.</p>
<p>The minus sign indicates that the head in the piezometer declines when the barometer goes up. This should be obvious as the the water pressure increases by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(LE\,\Delta a\)</span> which is a fraction of the barometer pressure, which would cause the water level in the piezometer to rise, but at the same time the full barometer pressure pushes on the water table in the piezometer, which causes the water level to decline accordingly. Together, the net effect is a decline of the head in the piezometer by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(BE\,\Delta a\)</span>, a fraction of the barometer pressure change.</p>
<p>From the equivalence of the previous equation couple, it follows that</p>

<p>A famous example of the barometer efficiency was given by (Todd 1959; Todd and Mays 2005), <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-todd-baro-graph"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 18</span></a>. This example is used here because it is famous as one of the first-ever published. However, barometer effects are always seen in piezometers in confined aquifers. The barometer efficiency generally varies between 20% and 80%.</p>
<p>The barometer influence causes a normally observed noisy behavior of the head time series from confined and semi-confined aquifers. This noisy behavior occurs also when groundwater is in perfect rest. Barometer pressure fluctuations do affect both the head measured in piezometers as the pressure measured in pressure gauges. Only if heads are measured at short time intervals of hours rather than weeks, would the noisy behavior of the head in confined aquifers actually show its clear one-to-one relation with the course of the barometer pressure. Therefore, such a noisy time series behavior actually shows that a piezometer is in a (semi-)confined aquifer. Unless we have very thick unsaturated zones with substantial resistance against air flow, we will not see much if any barometer fluctuation in water-table aquifers (Rasmussen and Crawford 1997).</p>

<p>If the total pressure <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span> is increased by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta p\)</span>, the porous medium is compressed together with the water that it contains. Clearly, the increase of the water pressure will also compress the individual grains. However, sand grains are about 50 times less compressible than water. Therefore, the effect of the grains being compressed themselves can be safely neglected.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the porous medium (the skeleton of grains) itself is far less stiff than the grains themselves. The porous medium is essentially compressed due to some deformation of the grains at the expense of the porosity of the medium. In fact, as it turns out, the compressibility of the porous medium is of the same order of magnitude as that of the water, so they must both be taken into account.</p>

<p>Hence, the volume <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_{0}\)</span> is compressed by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta V\)</span> when the pressure <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span> is increased by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta p\)</span>.</p>
<p>Assume the aquifer to be of infinite lateral extent, so that the only possible compression is downward.

Hence, both springs underlie the same compression <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta H\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let the water have a compressibility <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha\)</span> meaning that a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m^{3}\)</span> of water would be compressed by the fraction <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha\)</span> for each increase of the water pressure by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1\,\mathrm{N/m^{2}}\)</span>.

These compressibilities, therefore, have dimension <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathrm{m^{3}/m^{3}/\left(N/m^{2}\right)}=\mathrm{m^{2}/N}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now consider that the soil was put under an extra total pressure of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta p\)</span> causing it to be compressed by the fraction <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta H/H_{0}=\Delta V/V_{0}\)</span>.

<p>Because the grains are considered incompressible, it follows that the change of pore volume equals the change of the total volume. Therefore, for the water we have a relative volume change (= compression) of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta V\)</span> per <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\epsilon V_{0}\)</span>.

<p>Because we have now related both <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta\sigma_{w}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta\sigma_{w}\)</span> to the relative volume change <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta V/V_{0}\)</span>, we also know the ratio between the change of the effective pressure and the water pressure</p>

<p>Now consider the situation in which we lower the water pressure, for instance by extracting water from the aquifer. Lowering of the water pressure in no way changes the total pressure. Therefore, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta p=0\)</span>, which yields</p>

<p>However, the amount of water squeezed out of the porous medium changes. A lowering of head causes an increase of the effective pressure (grain pressure), and, hence, is associated with a compression of the porous medium. Therefore, an increase of the effective pressure ( <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta\sigma_{e}&gt;0\)</span>), reduces the pore volume by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta V\)</span> due to which the same volume of water is squeezed from the porous medium</p>

<p>The compressibility of water is</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{aligned}
\alpha &amp; = &amp; -\frac{1}{V_{w,0}}\frac{\partial V_{w}}{\partial\sigma_{w}}\,\mathrm{\mathrm{\left[L^{2}/F\right]^{2}}}\end{aligned}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha\approx4.4\times10^{10}\,\mathrm{m^{2}/N}\)</span>. Clearly, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\partial V_{w}/V_{w,0}\)</span> is the relative change of the water volume. There is some dependency on dissolved components, water containing dissolved gas, may be up to three times more compressible than water without dissolved gas under normal pore pressure (Lyons, William C. (2010): Working Guide to Reservoir Engineering; Elsevier).</p>
<p>The compressibility of the porous medium is</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\beta=-\frac{1}{V_{T,0}}\frac{\partial V_{T}}{\partial\sigma_{e}}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\partial V_{T}/V_{T,0}\)</span> is the relative change of the volume of the porous medium. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_{T}\)</span> is, the total volume of the considered soil (including its pores). <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma_{e}\)</span> is the effective stress (=grain pressure), i.e. that part of the total stress, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span>, that is not carried by the water pressure <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma_{w}\)</span>. The total pressure equals the weight of the overburden, i.e. that of the overlying formations including the water that they contain. Hence <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma_{e}=p-\sigma_{w}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The soil compressibility <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta\)</span> is the gradient of a stress-strain curve (relative volume change as a function of effective stress) of a dry soil sample put under increased stress in the laboratory, such that side-ward movement is prevented, exactly as it is the case in the actual aquifer under uniform vertical stress. Unlike water, the compressibility of soil is not necessarily a constant. If the soil is put under higher stress than it had ever supported before, then it consolidates, meaning that the change of volume is largely irreversible. But under lower than historic stresses, a constant compressibility can be determined, and truly elastic behavior can be assumed. It should be clear, that this compressibility depends on porosity.</p>
<p>Gun (1980) presented the following relationship between the compressibility of aquifers and depth based on laboratory measurements that were carried out by Van der Knaap (1959, unfortunately no direct reference).</p>

<p>Even far from the ocean and even after correcting for varying barometer pressures, the groundwater head in confined aquifers may show a response that closely resembles tides. This fluctuation matches the passage of the sun and the moon due to a rotating earth, exactly like it is the case with sea tides, ((Todd 1959; Todd and Mays 2005; Boemen, Lekkerkerker, and Molen 1989)), <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-earth-tides"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 21</span></a>.</p>

<p>Like normal tides, earth tides are an indirect consequence such gravity variations. It can be shown that they are caused as an indirect effect of the deformation of the earth’s mantle on which the stiff crust floats. A bulge is formed by the mantle by the attraction of the sun and the moon. The earth crust itself is so thin compared to the earth mantle that it behaves like a thin hard sheet floating on the mantle and is stretched by the mantle as it bulges out under tidal attraction. During stretching, porosity increases and the head lowers. When the stretching is released, the opposite occurs as is shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-earth-tides"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 21</span></a>.</p>
<p>This variation may be estimated with up to 50% accuracy from solid earth-tide theory (Kamp and Gale 1983). The dilatation (stretching) is more or less fixed due to the relation with the mantle, but different, for any point on earth. According to Bredehoeft (1967) it is about</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\Delta\phi\approx\frac{10^{-8}}{S_{s}}\]</div>
<p>at moderate latitudes. Using this number, one may relate the expected magnitude of the water-level fluctuations directly to the specific storage coefficient. With <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S_{s}\)</span> in the order of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10^{-6}\)</span>/m for sandstones and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10^{-7}\)</span>/m for granites, a fluctuation amplitude of 1 to 10 cm may be expected.</p>
<p>A thorough analysis of earth tides is beyond the scope of this course. There is a wealth of literature on the subject; a good quantitative paper is Kamp and Gale (1983).</p>

<p>In this course, we will deal with transient groundwater flow in one-dimensional and radial situations (wells) for which analytic solutions are available. Analytic solutions are important because they allow insight in the behavior of the groundwater system, whereas numerical solutions do not; they only produce numbers. Analytic solutions are also important because they allow checking numerical models and checking numerical models is always necessary, not just because of possible errors in the model, but also because of possible errors in the input of the model. Analytical solutions also allow analysis of numerical models, which helps to understand their outcome. Finally, analytical solutions are powerful because they allow a rapid result with minimal input. They become even more powerful if combined with superposition and convolution.</p>

<p>We will treat analytical solutions for one layer only. Analytical solutions for more than one layer exist and have been extended to arbitrary numbers of layers in the 1980s by Kick Hemker and Kees Maas, see for instance Hemker (1985; Maas 1986; Hemker and Maas 1987). These solutions require matrix computations, which were cumbersome at the time, but which may nowadays be readily computed in programs like Python. Nevertheless, we limit ourselves in this course to single-layer cases.</p>
<p>Let us first derive the partial differential equation, starting with continuity. Considering a small slice of an aquifer of length <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta x\)</span> (cross section) and write its dynamic water budget in terms of flow rates, assuming a constant aquifer thickness <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(D\)</span></p>

<p>This means that for 1D groundwater dynamics, we will mostly work with solutions of the following partial differential equation where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s=s\left(x,t\right)\)</span> is called the head change or often also the drawdown, especially when dealing with groundwater extraction and wells</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-eq-diffusion-equation-in-s">
<span class="eqno">(8)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-eq-diffusion-equation-in-s" title="Permalink to this equation"></a></span>\[\frac{\partial s}{\partial t}=\frac{kD}{S}\frac{\partial^{2}s}{\partial x^{2}}\]</div>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#equation-eq-diffusion-equation-in-s">Eq.8</a> is known as the diffusion equation. It appears in many scientific fields like like diffusion, dispersion, heat conduction, sorption, consolidation, etc. Many researchers have derived solutions for this partial differential equation for specific boundary and initial conditions. The coefficient <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S/kD\)</span> is called the diffusivity, often written as a thick D, like <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{D}\)</span>, which always has dimension <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathrm{\left[L^{2}/T\right]}\)</span> whatever the scientific application is. The diffusivity is the ratio of the ease of the flow (transmissivity) and the storage:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\mathbb{D}=\frac{kD}{S}\]</div>
<p>In the case of a phreatic (unconfined, water-table) aquifer, the aquifer thickness is no longer constant. Unfortunately, there are no transient solutions that take a time-varying aquifer thickness into account. Linearization is then unavoidable, meaning that one has to choose a proper average aquifer thickness (or transmissivity) and remain vigilant that the head change should remain small with respect to the saturated thickness of the aquifer.</p>
<p>The partial differential equation can also be viewed in this basic left-hand and right-hand parts</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[kD\frac{\partial^{2}s}{\partial x^{2}}=S\frac{\partial s}{\partial t}\]</div>
<p>in which the left-hand side describes the flow in the aquifer and the right-hand side the storage. To readily understand and let sink in the meaning of this partial differential equation, it is perhaps easiest to integrate both sides over a distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta x\)</span> to get</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[kD\intop_{x}^{x+\Delta x}\frac{\partial^{2}s}{\partial x^{2}}dx=S\intop_{x}^{x+\Delta x}\frac{\partial s}{\partial t}dx\]</div>
<p>which equals</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[kD\left(\frac{\partial s}{\partial x}\rvert_{x+\Delta x}-\frac{\partial s}{\partial x}\rvert_{x}\right)=\left(S\Delta x\right)\frac{\partial s}{\partial t}\]</div>
<p>This clearly shows that the left-hand side is the net inflow of a piece with length <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta x\)</span> (having dimension [L <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^{2}\)</span>/T] or [L <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^{3}\)</span>/T] per unit length perpendicular to the cross section of the aquifer, hence [L <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^{2}\)</span>/T], while the right-hand side equals the storage over the same aquifer distance with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span> [L <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^{3}\)</span>/L <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^{2}\)</span>/L] (volume per unit of aquifer surface area per unit of head increase per unit of time).</p>
<p>Also notice that</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\frac{\partial^{2}s}{\partial x^{2}}\]</div>
<p>is the curvature of the head. Whenever that is positive, there is an net inflow at the considered location originating from the aquifer adjacent to the considered point or infinitesimally small section.</p>
<p>Finally notice that we can replace the head change <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\)</span> (normally used for (semi-)confined aquifers) by the absolute head <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h\)</span> (normally used for water-table aquifers). This makes absolutely no difference as only the derivatives of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h\)</span> play a role in the equation, which are the same. Just read <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\)</span> as head difference relative to some initial or average condition.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">6.3.1. </span>Groundwater fluctuations due to sinusoidal tides<a class="headerlink" href="#groundwater-fluctuations-due-to-sinusoidal-tides" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>A number of transient problems can be analyzed by assuming sinusoidal water-level or flow fluctuations at a boundary, at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x=0\)</span> say. Generally, the resulting heads and flows within the aquifer will then also behave like a sine which will have the same frequency. If we have the analytic solution for head or flow in the aquifer due to harmonic fluctuating at the boundary, we may solve many related and more complex problems by superposition, that is by combining solutions of arbitrary frequencies, amplitudes and phase shifts. This way, hourly, daily, weekly and seasonal fluctuations may be readily combined. Examples of applications are tides in groundwater en the depth penetration of temperature fluctuations at ground surface.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#fig-sinoidal-water-level-fluctuation"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 23</span></a> shows a cross section through a confined aquifer (yellow) that extends to infinity at the right. At <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x=0\)</span> this aquifer is in direct connection with a surface-water body with a fluctuating water level, which causes fluctuations of head and flow in the adjacent aquifer, which are delayed and dampened relative to the forced fluctuation at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x=0\)</span>.</p>
<p>The partial differential equation for this system has already been derived (see <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-eq-diffusion-equation-in-s">Eq.8</a>). It may be solved for a sinusoidal fluctuation of the water level at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x=0\)</span>. We just assume the solution of the head <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\)</span> in the aquifer relative to the mean value without fluctuation, to be also sinusoidal with the same frequency (same angular velocity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\omega\)</span> [radians/T]), but add a phase shift ( <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-bx\)</span>) and assume an amplitude which is reduced by the factor <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(e^{-ax}\)</span> relative to the amplitude <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> of the tide at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x=0\)</span>:</p>

<span class="eqno">(9)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-eq-sine-solution-without-phase" title="Permalink to this equation"></a></span>\[s\left(x,t\right)=A\,e^{-ax}\sin\left(\omega t-bx\right)\]</div>
<p>The full tide time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T\)</span> relates to the angular velocity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\omega\)</span> as</p>

<span class="eqno">(10)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-eq-cycle-time" title="Permalink to this equation"></a></span>\[\omega T=2\pi\]</div>
<p>Notice that we can always change the phase of the tide by adding an arbitrary angle <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\nu\)</span> to the argument of the sine. For an aquifer with constant <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(kD\)</span> and storage coefficient <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span> this solution is indeed valid for</p>

<p>The proof is given in the box below. The proof fills the presumed solution into the partial differential equation and sees under which conditions the solution is true. It turns out to be as given in <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-eq-afluctuation">Eq.11</a>. The relations may also be derived for the situation in which the aquifer is semi-confined. Of course, this is more complicated and beyond this course. However, the solution is given in the box below for possible future reference.</p>
<p>Below the proof is given for the solution</p>
<p>As can be seen, an the arbitrary constant <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta_{0}\)</span> does not affect the proof of correctness. This constant is merely a phase shift at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t=0\)</span>. Therefore, the solution can also be given including this extra phase shift at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t=0\)</span>, which may be useful when superimposing many fluctuations that differ in amplitude was well as in phase:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-eq-sfluctuaionstage">

<p>To see that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta_{0}\)</span> is a phase shift, just fill in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x=0\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t=0\)</span>.</p>
<p>The discharge is obtained by using Darcy</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-eq-qfluctuationstage">

<p>A direct approach is taking the argument of the sinus and demanding that the argument of the sine at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t+T\)</span> at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> (where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T\)</span> is the cycle time) is the same as the argument of the sine at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> but at location <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x+\Delta x\)</span></p>

\[\left[\omega\left(t+T\right)-ax+\beta_{0}\right]=\left[\omega t-a\left(x+\Delta x\right)+\beta_{0}\right]\]</div>

<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\omega T=a\Delta x=0\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{aligned}

<p>noting that the cycle time equals <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T=\frac{2\pi}{\omega}\)</span>, we get</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\Delta x_{full\,wave}=\frac{2\pi}{a}\]</div>
<p>with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a=\sqrt{\frac{\omega S}{2kD}}\)</span>, we also have</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\Delta x_{full\,wave}=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{2kD}{\omega S}}\]</div>
<p>So, the larger <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(kD\)</span> the longer the wave length, the larger the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span> the shorter and the larger the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\omega\)</span>, the shorter the wavelength will be, which all makes sense.</p>
<p>We have now seen that the head is indeed a damped sine. The damping is stronger for higher frequencies, larger storage coefficients and lower conductivities.

<h3><span class="section-number">6.3.2. </span>Using characteristic time and length<a class="headerlink" href="#using-characteristic-time-and-length" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>The solution may be more intuitively expressed using characteristic time and length. The charactersitci time would be the cycle time, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T\)</span>, i.e. it takes for one full tide to complete</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\omega T=2\pi\rightarrow T=\frac{2\pi}{\omega}\rightarrow\omega=\frac{2\pi}{T}\rightarrow\omega t=2\pi\frac{t}{T}\]</div>
<p>Also, we could set a characteristic length of the tide the aquifer to</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\lambda=\frac{1}{a}\]</div>
<p>The envelopes are thus now expressed as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[-A\,e^{-\frac{x}{\lambda}}\le s_{x,t}\le+A\,e^{-\frac{x}{\lambda}}\]</div>
<p>so that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\)</span> now is the length over which the maximum amplitude declines by a factor <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(e\approx2.3\)</span>.</p>
<p>The relation with the length over which the amplitude declines by exactly a factor 2 is easily derived</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
e^{-\frac{x+\Delta x}{\lambda}} &amp; =0.5e^{-\frac{x}{\lambda}}\\
-\frac{x+\Delta x}{\lambda} &amp; =\ln0.5-\frac{x}{\lambda}\\
\Delta x &amp; =\left(\ln2\right)\,\lambda\\
\Delta x &amp; \approx0.69\,\lambda\end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>As always when we have an exponentially declining relationship, we can define a half-time or half-length. That halftime or half-length is always <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ln\left(2\right)\approx69\%\)</span> of the characteristic time of characteristic length, i.e. the time or length in which the exponent declines by a factor <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(e\approx2.3\)</span>.</p>
<p>The characteristic length of the tidal wave in the aquifer is, therefore</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\lambda=\frac{1}{a}=\sqrt{\frac{2}{\omega}\frac{kD}{S}}=\sqrt{\frac{T}{\pi}\frac{kD}{S}}\]</div>
<p>and the half-length is just 69% of this.</p>
<p>Filling in the characteristic length and time gives</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[h_{x,t}=A\,e^{-\frac{x}{\lambda}}\sin\left(2\pi\frac{t}{T}-\frac{x}{\lambda}+\theta\right)\]</div>
<p>If one wishes to express all terms within the argument of the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sin\)</span> in terms of the full tidal cycle, one would write</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[h_{x,t}=A\,e^{-\frac{x}{\lambda}}\sin\left(2\pi\left(\frac{t}{T}-\frac{x}{2\pi\lambda}+\frac{\theta}{2\pi}\right)\right)\]</div>
<p>This directly shows that the distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x=2\pi\lambda\)</span> is the length of a full wave in the subsurface, and, therefore, the expression <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2\pi\lambda/T\)</span> is the velocity of the wave in the subsurface.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[v=\frac{2\pi\lambda}{T}=\frac{2\pi}{T}\sqrt{\frac{T}{\pi}\frac{kD}{S}}=\sqrt{\frac{2\times2\pi}{T}\frac{kD}{S}}=\sqrt{\frac{2\times2\pi}{2\pi}\omega\frac{kD}{S}}=\sqrt{2\omega\frac{kD}{S}}\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">

<p>For heat conduction in the subsurface, the same partial differential equation (also called“diffusion equation”) applies if we replace head change by temperature change. The only thing that changes is the so-called diffusivity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(kD/S\)</span>. The ease of flow, i.e. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(kD\)</span> with groundwater flow, is now replaced by the heat conduction <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\,\mathrm{\left[W/m\right]=\left[\left(\left(E/T\right)/L^{2}\right)/\left(K/L\right)\right]=\left[E/\left(TKL\right)\right]}\)</span> and the storage is replaced by the heat capacity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho c\,\mathrm{\left[E/L^{3}/K\right]}\)</span>. The dimension is again <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathrm{\left[L^{2}/T\right]}\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\mathbb{D=}\frac{\lambda}{\rho c}\,\mathrm{\left[\frac{E/\left(TKL\right)}{E/\left(KL^{3}\right)}\right]=\left[\frac{L^{2}}{T}\right]}\]</div>
<p>Notice that in the dimension <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E\)</span> = energy, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T\)</span> = time, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L\)</span> = length, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(K\)</span> = temperature (from Kelvin). Because both the heat conduction and the heat capacity consist of a contribution from both the water and the grains (solids) of the aquifer, we can compute them as a porosity-weighted combination of these contributions. With <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\epsilon\)</span> for porosity we then have</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
\lambda &amp; = &amp; \epsilon\lambda_{w}+\left(1-\epsilon\right)\lambda_{s}\\

<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho\,\mathrm{\left[M/L^{3}\right]}\)</span> is density and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c\,\mathrm{\left[E/\left(MK\right)\right]}\)</span>, i.e. heat per kg solids per degree kelvin (= degree Celsius).</p>
<p>The heat capacity of saturated sandy soils is about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda=3\,\mathrm{W/m/K}=3\,\mathrm{J/s/m/K}\)</span>. The specific heat capacity of water is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c_{w}=4018\,\mathrm{J/kg/K}\)</span> and that of sand grains <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c_{s}\approx800\,\mathrm{J/kg/K}\)</span>. With <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho_{s}\approx2650\,\mathrm{kg/m^{3}}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\epsilon\approx35\%\)</span> we get <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho c=2.85\times10^{6}\,\mathrm{J/m^{3}/K}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The diffusivity then becomes</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\mathbb{D}=\frac{\lambda}{\rho c}=\frac{3}{2.85\times10^{6}}=1.06\times10^{-6}\,\mathrm{m^{2}/s}=0.091\,\mathrm{m^{2}/d}\]</div>
<p>From which we have</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[a=\sqrt{\frac{\omega}{2\mathbb{D}}}=\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{T\mathbb{D}}}\]</div>
<p>With these values, one can compute between what values the temperature varies at any given depth as a function of the cycle time. For instance, the temperature fluctuation due to daily, weekly, monthly or yearly temperature fluctuations at ground surface. These envelopes are defined by</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[T_{mean}-A\,\exp\left(-az\right)\le temp\le T_{mean}+A\,\exp\left(-az\right)\]</div>
<p>with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> [K] the temperature fluctuation amplitude at ground surface.</p>
<p>The monthly temperature in the Netherlands varies between 3.1 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^{o}\)</span>C in January and 17.9 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^{o}\)</span>C in July. The yearly amplitude is thus 7.4 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^{o}\)</span>C; the year mean temperature being 10.5 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^{o}\)</span>C. Using this, we can compute the temperature envelopes, that is, the lowest and highest temperatures between which the actual temperature will vary. <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-temperature-envelopes-in-subsurface"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 27</span></a> shows the results, as computed for the same mean temperature and the same amplitude but for different cycle times as indicated in the legend. With these data, the yearly temperature variation will barely reach 20 m below ground surface. Ten-year temperature fluctuations will penetrate down to about 50 m and 30 year temperature variation would be recordable down to about 100 m. This implies that climate change may be measured using the change of the temperature at for instance 50 m below ground surface if measurements in the past are available, as is actually the case in the Netherlands.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">6.3.4. </span>Concluding remarks<a class="headerlink" href="#concluding-remarks" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>The derived partial differential equation applies to both groundwater flow and heat conduction. The only change is that head change is replaced by temperature change, transmissivity by heat conductance and the storage coefficient is replaced by heat capacity. Both heat conductance and heat capacity can be computed as a porosity weighted average of the contribution of the water and of the grains.</p>
<p>Sinusoidal analysis is useful to study the impact of ongoing fluctuations of the input on the groundwater. It is straightforward to compute the head and temperature envelopes defining the limits of a given sine input at a given distance or depth. Often, this is enough he understand the physics and estimate potential impact. Most importantly it is enough the understand the relation between the different parameters that play in this setting.</p>
<p>More complicated inputs can be constructed as a sum of a number of sin (or cosine) fluctuations, each with its own amplitude, frequency and phase shift. In fact, any input can be so constructed, although this may require the summation of many waves. On the other hand a given i.e. measured input may be split into individual waves using Fourier Analysis. Python has modules for that. This helps to find the dominant ones, and allows limiting the following analysis on only a few dominant waves. This simply means that this sinusoidal solution of the partial differential equations offers many ways to analyze groundwater systems of the type we considered. By superposition, these analysis can also be combined with other features such as wells.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">6.4. </span>Non-fluctuating interaction with surface water<a class="headerlink" href="#non-fluctuating-interaction-with-surface-water" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>In the previous section, we discussed the effect of sinusoidal variation of the level of a surface water that is in direct contact with a confined or unconfined aquifer. In this chapter, we’ll discuss the same hydrological setting, but in which the surface water level changes suddenly by a fixed amount.</p>
<section id="basins-of-half-infinite-lateral-extent">
<h3><span class="section-number">6.4.1. </span>Basins of half-infinite lateral extent<a class="headerlink" href="#basins-of-half-infinite-lateral-extent" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>Again, we consider a confined aquifer in direct contact with surface water as was done in the previous section. The situation is depicted in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-one-dimensional-groundwater-basin-rise-a"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 28</span></a>. The aquifer thickness, transmissivity and storage coefficient are everywhere the same. The aquifer is half-infinite, which means that its right end extends to infinity. We consider the aquifer as confined, because we will assume that its thickness is the same everywhere and stays so. This is required only to allow a closed analytical solution for the time-dependent groundwater flow. There are no time-dependent closed analytical solutions for water-table aquifers in which the transmissivity varies along with the head and, therefore, with time. We further assume the aquifer being in direct contact with the surface water. This implies that there is no hydraulic resistance of any kind between the surface water and the aquifer. This assumption keeps the analysis simple. However, solutions exist that take hydraulic resistance between the surface water and the aquifer into account as outlined in Bruggeman (1999), but are beyond this course.</p>
<p>We present here a basic analytical solution, which describes the change of head (and flow) caused by a sudden change of the surface-water level by an amount <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> [m].</p>
<p>In the confined case we use the elastic storage coefficient, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S=DS_{s}\)</span> and in the unconfined case we use the specific yield, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S_{y}\)</span>. In cases where we consider unconfined aquifers, the effective thickness of the aquifer changes along with the water table, and, therefore, also with the head. However, as long as the change of head is small compared to the thickness of the aquifer, we may still apply the solution in practice and accept the small error caused by the assumption of constant thickness.</p>
<p>Initially, the head is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\phi'\)</span> in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-one-dimensional-groundwater-basin-rise-a"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 28</span></a> and the head <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\phi\left(x,t\right)\)</span> varies in space and time due to a sudden change of head of the bounding surface water by an amount of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> m at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t=0\)</span>. The surface-water head remains at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\phi'+A\)</span> thereafter.</p>
<p>Because superposition applies (due to linear governing partial differential equation), we may just superimpose the change of head <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\left(x,t\right)=\phi\left(x,t\right)-\phi'\)</span>, irrespective of the actual situation. The only thing that matters to us. is the <strong>change of head</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\)</span> that is caused by the sudden change of the water level in the bounding surface water by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> m.</p>
<p>The case considered here is a base case. There exists a series of analytical solutions for other boundary conditions, which is presented in <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-higher-level-solutions"><span class="std std-ref">Higher-order solutions (not for exam)</span></a>. These solution are given for reference only, not for the exam.</p>

<p>Hence, the solution of the head change versus distance to the shore always has the shape of this curve, be it that the horizontal axis will be squeezed or stretched depending on the values of the parameters in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u\)</span>. The shorter the time, the larger <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u\)</span>, the more compressed is the horizontal axis. A small <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(kD\)</span> or large <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span> also has the effect of compressing the horizontal axis.</p>
<p>For the understanding it is convenient to express <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u=x/L\)</span> so that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L=\sqrt{4kDt/S}\)</span>, which is a constant for any fixed <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span>. For this fixed <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L\)</span> may be considered a characteristic distance, as it scales <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>. For instance, half of the initial head change has been reached when <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u\approx0.5\)</span> that is at a distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x=0.5L\)</span>. Also, the head change is about 10% of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u=1\)</span>, that is at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x=L\)</span>, with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L\)</span> fixed for the time of observation. No head rise has yet occurred for about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u=2.5\)</span>, hence, for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x&gt;2.5L\)</span>. This is all practical information when judging an actual situation, without the need for a computer.</p>
<p>The solution is only valid for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u&gt;0\)</span>, this is clear for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x^{2}\)</span> under the square root and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t&gt;0\)</span>. But when we express <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u\)</span> as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u=x\sqrt{\frac{S}{4kDt}},\)</span>this is not so obvious. However <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> is must be positive and seen as the distance from the point of consideration to the boundary with the head change. So in case this boundary as a coordinate <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x_{b}\)</span> and our point of consideration is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x_{0}\)</span> we should use <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x=\left|x_{0}-x_{b}\right|\)</span> in the formula of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u\)</span>, hence, treat <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> as a distance, being always positive.</p>
<p>It is also possible to plot <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mbox{erfc}\,u\)</span> and its derivative versus <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1/u^{2}\)</span>. To make the graph meaningful, we have to use a logarithmic scale for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1/u^{2}\)</span> as is shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-erfcand-its-derivative-versus-1overu"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 31</span></a>. The time scale is then proportional to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span>. We can write <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u^{2}=T/t\)</span> with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T=x^{2}S/\left(4kD\right)\)</span>, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T\)</span> can be considered a characteristic time for fixed distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>. We see that for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t/T\approx2\)</span>, about half the final (maximum) head change has been reached. It is useful and practical to consider this graph from the perspective of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t/T\)</span> instead of just <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span>. Taking this perspective, one only needs a single graph to cover all possible cases; the only thing that changes when choosing another observation point is the value of the characteristic time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T\)</span>. Then <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T\)</span> can be considered time characteristic for the situation at a chosen distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>. The graph in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-erfcand-its-derivative-versus-1overu"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 31</span></a> also shows that some time elapses before the influence of the river reaches the observation point. The value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1/u\)</span> for this time is about 0.4 as can be read from <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-erfcand-its-derivative-versus-1overu"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 31</span></a>. Hence, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t/T=0.16\)</span>. This result is also universal. 90% of the final head is reached at about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1/u^{2}=100\)</span>, so that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t=100T\)</span>.</p>
<p>For the discharge, we need the derivative, which is also shown in both figures.</p>

<span id="sec-higher-level-solutions"></span><h3><span class="section-number">6.4.3. </span>Higher-order solutions (not for exam)<a class="headerlink" href="#higher-order-solutions-not-for-exam" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>The previous well-known basic solution is the first of an infinite series of solutions of the same partial differential equation but for different boundary conditions, namely <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\left(0,t\right)=a\,t^{n/2}\)</span> with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a\)</span> a constant and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\ge0\)</span>. The solution given above is for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n=0\)</span>.</p>
<p>The entire series of solutions is given is given in Carslaw and Jaeger (1986) and Bruggeman (1999) but can be more conveniently written as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[s\left(x,t\right)=A\,t^{n/2}\frac{\mbox{i}^{n}\mbox{erfc}\,u}{\mbox{i}^{n}\mbox{erfc}\,0}\mbox{, with }u=\sqrt{\frac{x^{2}S}{4kDt}}\]</div>
<p>The function <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mbox{i}^{n}\mbox{erfc}\,u\)</span> is the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n^{th}\)</span> repeated integral of the complementary error function (Section 7.2 in Abramowitz and Stegun (1972)). A number of these functions is shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-higher-order-erfc-functions"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 33</span></a>. These higher order repeated integrals are not in Abramowitz and Stegun (1964) but can be easily computed using a recursive expression given below.</p>
<p>By definition</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\mbox{i}^{n}\mbox{erfc}\,z=\intop_{z}^{\infty}\mbox{i}^{n-1}\mbox{erfc}\left(\zeta\right)d\zeta\]</div>
<p>with</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\mbox{i}^{0}\mbox{erfc}\,z=\mbox{erfc}\,z\]</div>
<p>and</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\mbox{i}^{-1}\mbox{erfc}\,z=\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}e^{-z^{2}}\]</div>
<p>Higher order functions may be computed by the following recursive relation</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\mbox{i}^{n}\mbox{erfc}\,z=\frac{-z}{n}\mbox{i}^{n-1}\mbox{erfc}\,z+\frac{1}{2n}\mbox{i}^{n-1}\mbox{erfc}\,z\]</div>
<p>By applying Darcy’s law, we find the discharge</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[Q\left(x,t\right)=\frac{\sqrt{kDS}}{2\sqrt{t}}A\,t^{n/2}\frac{\mbox{i}^{n-1}\mbox{erfc}\,u}{\mbox{i}^{n}\mbox{erfc}\,0}\]</div>
<p>Instead of expressing <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\left(0,t\right)=At^{n/2}\)</span> we could write <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q\left(0,t\right)=Bt^{n/2}\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\ge0\)</span>. This is more convenient when we like to specify the flow instead of the head. If we just write <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{\sqrt{kDS}}{2\sqrt{t}}A=B\)</span>, we get</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[Q\left(x,t\right)=B\,t^{n/2}\frac{\mathrm{i^{n-1}erfc}\,u}{\mathrm{i^{n}erfc}\,0}\]</div>
<p>and at the same time</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[s\left(x,t\right)=\frac{2\sqrt{t}}{\sqrt{kDS}}B\,t^{n/2}\frac{\mathrm{i^{n}erfc}\,u}{\mathrm{i^{n}erfc}\,0}\]</div>
<p>A basic solution is obtained by setting <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n=0\)</span>, so that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q\left(0,t\right)=B\)</span> is constant. In that case, the head at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x=0\)</span> declines according to the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sqrt{t}\)</span>. When the discharge increases linearly, the head at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x=0\)</span> changes according to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\sqrt{t}\)</span>. On the other hand, when the drawdown is constant at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x=0,\)</span> the discharge is inversely proportional to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sqrt{t}\)</span> and when the head at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x=0\)</span> rises linearly with time, the discharge increases according to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sqrt{t}\)</span>.</p>
<p>These functions may be used to compute the head and flow due to either a constant or changing head at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x=0\)</span> or due to a constant or changing flow at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x=0\)</span>. Computations are easily done in Python or even in Excel after the functions have been implemented.</p>

<h4><span class="section-number">6.4.3.1. </span>Example:<a class="headerlink" href="#example" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
<p>For instance, the water level in Lake Nasser in Egypt has risen by 60 m between the mid 1960s, when the dam at Aswan was closed, and the end of the 1980s, when the new lake was full. This boils down to rise of the lake level of about 3 m/year. Just assume that the bordering aquifer is 200 m thick and that it has a conductivity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k=1\,\mathrm{m/d}\)</span> and a specific yield <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S_{y}=0.1\)</span>. How far would the effect of the filling of the lake reach in the adjacent aquifer? How much lake water would have been stored in that aquifer in that same period?</p>
<p>Using the expression and setting <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n=2\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A=3\)</span> m/y, we have</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[s\left(x,t\right)=A\,t^{n/2}\frac{\mbox{i}^{n}\mbox{erfc}\,u}{\mbox{i}^{n}\mbox{erfc}\,0}\mbox{, with }u=\sqrt{\frac{x^{2}S}{4kDt}}\mbox{ and with }A=3\,\mathrm{m/y}\mbox{ and further }n=2\]</div>
<p>This specifies a linear rise of the lake level over time. With <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n=2\)</span> we get</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[s\left(x,t\right)=A\,t\frac{\mbox{i}^{2}\mbox{erfc}\,u}{\mbox{i}^{2}\mbox{erfc}\,0}\mbox{, with }Q\left(x,t\right)=\sqrt{\frac{kDS}{4t}}A\,\frac{\mbox{i}^{1}\mbox{erfc}\,u}{\mbox{i}^{2}\mbox{erfc}\,0}\]</div>
<p>With proper values of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(kD\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span>, a graph can be made for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q\)</span> as a function of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> for given times. Alternatively, we can make graphs of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q\)</span> as a function of time for given values of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>. The results are shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-lake-nasser-example"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 34</span></a>. The top figure shows the head in the aquifer as a function of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> for different times. The middle figure shows the infiltration at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x=0\)</span> as a function of time. The bottom figure shows the development of the head over time at different distances from the lake bank. Note that the lake level remains constant after <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t=20\)</span> years. The head at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x=0\)</span>, therefore, remains equal till the lake level reaches a total rise of 60 m thereafter. After that, the lake level is kept constant. The infiltration <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q\)</span> then sharply declines because the head does not rise further. This reaching of a constant lake level is implemented by superimposing the solution for a lake with a water level that declines with the same speed (i.e <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A=-3\)</span> m/y) starting at the moment the top lake-level is reached. It is a good exercise to implement this yourself.</p>
<p>Of course, the same case can be simulated using the function for a sudden rise of the lake level. But then the actual gradual rise of the lake level must be subdivided into many small sudden steps, the result of which must be added together (i.e. superimposed) to obtain the overall solution. The results is shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-lake-nasser-example-sudden-changes"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 37</span></a>. The rise of the head and lake are shown in the lower picture, the flow at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x=0\)</span> is shown in the picture in the middle. The results are essentially the same, but the infiltration at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x=0\)</span> fluctuates quite heavily under the discrete yearly sudden head increments of 3 m each. At larger distances, however, these steps damp out. Of course, the smaller the steps, the smoother the result will be. This example shows that it may be much more convenient and require less work to directly apply the solution for the linear rise of the head at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x=0\)</span>.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">6.4.5. </span>Superposition in time, half-infinite aquifer<a class="headerlink" href="#superposition-in-time-half-infinite-aquifer" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>Consider a half-infinite aquifer in direct connection with surface water at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x=0\)</span>. The analytical solution for the change of the groundwater head <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\left(x,t\right)\)</span> that is caused by a sudden change of the surface water level by an amount <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t=0\)</span>, which was given before :</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[s\left(x,t\right)=A\,\mathrm{erfc}\sqrt{\frac{x^{2}S}{4kDt}}\mbox{, with }t\ge0\mbox{, where }s\left(x,t\right)=0\mbox{ for }t&lt;0\]</div>
<p>The head change <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\left(x,t\right)\)</span> due to an arbitrary sudden change of the surface-water level by an amount <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A_{i}\)</span> happening at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t_{i}\)</span> can be obtained by superposition as usual. Using <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> as an event index, we then get</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[s\left(x,t\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left\{ dA_{i}\,\mathrm{erfc}\sqrt{\frac{x^{2}S}{4kD\left(t-t_{ci}\right)}}\right\} \mbox{, with }t\ge t_{i}\]</div>
<p>Each term is nonexistent, hence zero, for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t&lt;t_{i}\)</span>. The surface-water level at any time is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\left(0,t\right)=\sum_{1}^{N}dA_{i}\mbox{, with }t&gt;t_{ci}\)</span>, because each sudden change of water level is supposed to last forever after it happened at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t_{ci}\)</span>. This way, one can compute the head change and, of course, the flow in an aquifer due to an arbitrary variation of the surface water level at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x=0\)</span>. Of course, if the surface water would vary continuously, like one or more <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(sine\)</span> functions, one would rather use the solution for a sine boundary head to simplify the computations. Even a combination is possible, because superposition applies. Notice that the time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> in the expression above is the simulation time and will be represented in the computer by an array of times at some arbitrary constant interval, while the time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t_{ci}\)</span> the“change”-time will be a series of times at which the surface-water level at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x=0\)</span> changes. The values <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t_{ci}\)</span> are independent of the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> values, and the number of change times is is usually much less than the number of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> values.</p>
<p>We will simply compute the head due to the sudden head change <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dA_{i}\)</span> happening at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x=0\)</span> at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t_{ch_{i}}\)</span> for all <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t&gt;t_{ci}\)</span> and add this to the head changes already computed for earlier times.</p>

<p>In many practical situations, groundwater basins will have a limited width instead of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> extending to infinity. Examples are groundwater basins that are bounded by a fixed-head boundary on either side. This includes basins that are closed on one side, because such a line of no flow is just the water divide, which is equivalent to a symmetrical basin of double width having the same head boundary on either side.</p>

<p>Often, watersheds can be regarded as a set of sub-basins bounded by river branches on either side of the water divide between them (see <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-map-of-the-brahmaputra-basin"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 42</span></a>). The basins considered here, can be regarded as a simplification of the groundwater system between two river branches, but also as a parcel of arable land bounded by two ditches. It’s just a matter of scale. The basins considered here may, therefore, be as narrow as a parcel of arable land or a meadow between ditches as one can find anywhere in the Netherlands of perhaps 100 m wide; but they can just as well be a strip of land land between brooks or tributaries that are several km apart, between river branches tens of km apart or a desert of which the boundaries lie at several hundred of km from each other.</p>
<p>Of course, the surface waters bounding most basins are not straight lines. Nevertheless, we limit ourselves to in this course to basins that are bounded by two parallel straight head boundaries. This makes the flow essentially one-dimensional when we ignore resistance due to vertical flow components with in the aquifer. The latter is very often justified because the vertical flow components are small compared to the horizontal ones. If this assumption is not valid like near a shallow surface-water body, where flow lines bend upward and convergence causing an extra loss of head, we may always add such effects separately.</p>
<p>In the following sections, we’ll learn how to compute the variation of head and flow in one-dimensional basins (basins in which the only spatial dimension is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> and not <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z\)</span>, that are affected by the head changes at their two head boundaries, see <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-head-after-sudden-rise-left-and-right"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 47</span></a>) which shows such a basin (a strip of land) bounded on either side by a surface-water body in direct contact with the aquifer, such that the water level of these surface-water bodies determine the head at either side of the basin.</p>
<p>We first consider the case where the left-hand boundary head suddenly rises by a fixed amount <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> m, while the right-hand boundary head is kept the constant (see <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-confined-groundwater-basin-left-rise"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 43</span></a>). We will see that maintaining the right-hand head boundary at zero, requires superposition of the effect of an infinite number of“mirror” strips of land. After that, we consider a given change of head on either side of the strip. This case is also solved by by superposition of an infinite number of equally sized land strips. The case in which the sudden head change is the same on either side of the land strip is just a special one. However, it allows us to compare it with a different general solution describing the drainage of a strip of land in which the head is initially uniform at a level <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> above its two boundaries. Both solutions are equivalent although they look mathematically completely different. The latter solution, however, allows drastic simplification when time is large enough and gives us a time constant that is characteristic of the basin, which allows analyzing time characteristics of any basin with a simple expression.</p>
<p>The mentioned superposition of an infinite number of strips leads to superposition patterns that are shown below the respective figure s. These patterns allow immediate recognition of the correctness of the superposition pattern required handle the head boundaries on both ends of the basin or the strip of land we want to analyze.</p>

<p><a class="reference internal" href="#fig-confined-groundwater-basin-left-rise"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 43</span></a> shows a groundwater basin with a constant transmissivity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(kD\)</span> and storage coefficient <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span>. It has a width <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L\)</span> and is bounded on either side by surface water in direct contact with the confined aquifer. The water level at the left changes suddenly by an amount <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span>. How can we solve this, given the solution for the half-space (i.e. in which <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> runs from 0 to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\infty\)</span>) that we already have?</p>
<p>The answer is: by superposition by using mirror “ditches”.</p>
<p>The solution for the half-space has been shown before</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[s\left(x,t\right)=A\,\mathrm{erfc}\left(x\sqrt{\frac{S}{4kDt}}\right)\mbox{, where }x\ge0\mbox{, and }t&gt;0\]</div>
<p>However, this solution will cause the head at point <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> to start rising after some time, while in reality the head should remain 0 at point B. How wan we deal with this mathematically?</p>
<p>When we forget the surface water at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x=B\)</span>, but instead assume a ditch at a distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L\)</span> to the right of point B, in which the water level was suddenly lowered at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t=0\)</span> by an amount <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> m (i.e. changed by an amount - <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span>), then the rising an point B due to the ditch at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> would be exactly counterbalanced (neutralized) by the decline in point B due to the ditch at a distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L\)</span> to the right of point B. As a consequence of both, the head at point B remains zero, which is exactly the desired effect. In this case, we have one mirror ditch with opposite head change at distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L\)</span> to the right of point B.</p>
<p>However, this one mirror ditch does not solve the whole problem, because after some more time, it will cause the head at point A to start declining, and so the head at point A would not remain fixed at the value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> m.</p>
<p>To compensate for that, we need another mirror ditch at distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2L\)</span> to the left of point A with opposite head change compared to to the first mirror ditch. But this head change at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2L\)</span> left of point A will cause the head at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2L\)</span> to the right of point B to change over time. This requires a mirror ditch at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(4L\)</span> to the left of point A to neutralize this effect. And so on. We will, therefore, end up with an infinite number of mirror ditches just to make sure that boundary conditions at both sides of our initial basin are kept that their desired values.</p>
<p>The lower picture in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-confined-groundwater-basin-left-rise"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 43</span></a> intends to make this clear. The darker yellow block represents the original basin of width <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L\)</span>. Each arrow represents a mirror ditch and its direction show whether the water level in it goes up or down.</p>
<p>Is this solution with the shown scheme of mirror ditches correct? Well, this is. In fact, it’s easy to see its correctness at a glance. Just look at the lower picture in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-confined-groundwater-basin-left-rise"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 43</span></a> and consider point B, in which the head should remain zero. As it should become immediately clear by inspection, each ditch with lowered water level to the right of point B is exactly canceled at B by each ditch at the same distance to the left of point B with a rising level. Hence, the effect in point B of all ditches to the right is exactly canceled by all ditches to the left of point B. Therefore, the head at point B remains at zero.</p>
<p>On the other hand, all ditches to the right of point A are exactly compensated at point A by all ditches to the left of point A, except for the ditch at point A itself. Hence, the total effect of all the mirror ditches together at A is zero, so that the only remaining effect at A is that of the level rise at A itself. That too can be seen at a glance from the lower picture in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-confined-groundwater-basin-left-rise"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 43</span></a>.</p>
<p>With respect to the origin of the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>-axis, it does not matter where we choose it, we need only to make sure that the distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> in the formula is correct for each of the mirror wells. In <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-confined-groundwater-basin-left-rise"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 43</span></a>, the point with coordinate <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x=0\)</span> was chosen at point <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span>, which makes the mirror ditches symmetrical with respect to this point. The <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>-coordinate of ditch <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> to the left is then</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[-\left(2i-1\right)L\]</div>
<p>and that of ditch <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> to the right of point <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> is</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[+\left(2i-1\right)L\]</div>
<p>The (absolute) distance to an arbitrary point with coordinate <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> is then for the left ditch</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\left|x+\left(2i-1\right)L\right|\]</div>
<p>and to the right ditch</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\left|x-\left(2i-1\right)L\right|\]</div>
<p>We can use these distances directly in the formula that sums the effect of all wells to yield the net result. This gives for the head change within the strip of land, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-L\le x\le0\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[s\left(x,t\right)=A\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\left\{ \mbox{erfc}\left[\left|x+\left(2i-1\right)L\right|\sqrt{\frac{S}{4kDt}}\right]-\mbox{erfc}\left[\left|x-\left(2i-1\right)L\right|\sqrt{\frac{S}{4kDt}}\right]\right\}\]</div>
<p>and doing the same for the for the discharge expression, yields</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[Q\left(s,t\right)=A\sqrt{\frac{kDS}{\pi t}}\,\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\left\{ \mbox{exp}\left[-\left(x+\left(2i-1\right)L\right)^{2}\frac{S}{4kDt}\right]+\mbox{exp}\left[\left(x-\left(2i-1\right)L\right)^{2}\frac{S}{4kDt}\right]\right\}\]</div>
<p>Note that the second term in the formula for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\left(x,t\right)\)</span> has a minus sign because of the water level in the right-hand ditches was lowered. However, the second term in the formula for the discharge <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q\left(s,t\right)\)</span> has a plus sign, because both the left-hand and the right-hand ditches cause a positive flow, i.e. a flow in the positive direction of the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>-axis.</p>
<p>When you implement this scheme in Python, make sure you start the sum (loop) with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i=1\)</span> and not <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i=0\)</span>.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#fig-striplefthandrise"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 44</span></a> shows the results for several times. Because the point <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x=0\)</span> was chosen to be at the point B at the right-hand side of the strip, the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>-values within the strip are now negative. Also notice that the steady-state solution, which is reached after about 3 days, has a head that declines linearly from 2.5 m at the left to 0 at the right of the strip. The discharge <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q\)</span> through the aquifer, therefore, must equal <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q=A/L\times kD=2.5/250\times600=6\)</span> m<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^{2}\)</span>/d. This is indeed the case all along the width of the strip as can be seen in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-striplefthandrise"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 44</span></a>.</p>

<p>We may choose any point as the origin of the x-axis. Let’s put it at a distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a\)</span> to the right of point A. The the coordinate of ditch <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> to the left would be <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x_{i}=-2iL-a\)</span> for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0\le i&lt;\infty\)</span> and that of ditch <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> to the right would be <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x_{i}=2iL-a\)</span> for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1\le i&lt;\infty\)</span>.

<p>Now consider the general case, in which the head at the left and right change by different values. Again, we need mirror ditches. This time not only to fix the left-hand head at the desired level, but also the right-hand head. Of course, you can regard this case from the perspective of the problem that we just solved. It is then the sum of the case in which the left-hand level was raised by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> m and the right-hand level was kept at zero and the same case of which the right-hand size was raised by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> m and the left-hand side was kept at zero.</p>

<p>But let’s just solve it, after taking the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x=0\)</span> at a convenient location, which would be in the center. Note however, you can put it at another location, but then the formulas change accordingly.</p>
<p>The image at the bottom of <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-strip-left-riseby-a-right-by-b"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 46</span></a> shows the strip and the mirror ditches. By looking at this picture, it should immediately be clear that this scheme of mirror ditches is correct. To see this, look at point A. You will then notice that each ditch to the left of A is compensated exactly by each ditch at the right of A. Therefore, the only effect of all the ditches at point A, including the ditch at pint A itself, is that of the ditch at point A itself; all others cancel at point A. Next focus on point B and notice that this is also true for point B. Hence, at point A, the only effect that remains is that of the head change in the ditch at point A, and at point B, the only effect that remains at point B is that o the head change of the ditch at point B.</p>
<p>With this in mind, it becomes straightforward to write the expression for the head within the strip of land. To do that, just consider a point <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> and write the distance to all the ditches in terms of strip width <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>. Doing this, we get</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{aligned}
s\left(x,t\right) &amp; = &amp; \dots\end{aligned}\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[A\,\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\left\{ \mbox{erfc}\left[\left\{ \left(2i-1\right)L-\frac{L}{2}+x\right\} \sqrt{\frac{S}{4kDt}}\right]-\mbox{erfc}\left[\left\{ \left(2i-1\right)L+\frac{L}{2}-x\right\} \sqrt{\frac{S}{4kDt}}\right]\right\} +\dots\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\dots+B\,\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\left\{ \mbox{erfc}\left[\left\{ \left(2i-1\right)L-\frac{L}{2}-x\right\} \sqrt{\frac{S}{4kDt}}\right]-\mbox{erfc}\left[\left\{ \left(2i-1\right)L+\frac{L}{2}+x\right\} \sqrt{\frac{S}{4kDt}}\right]\right\}\]</div>
<p>Like it was done above, a similar expression can be written down for the flow <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q\)</span>.</p>
<p>An example result is shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-head-after-sudden-rise-left-and-right"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 47</span></a> for the case where at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t=0\)</span> the head at the left boundary was raised by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A=2.5\)</span> m and at the right side by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B=1.5\)</span> m. Again, a steady state is reached after about 5 days, the flow is then constant, i.e. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\left(A-B\right)/L\times kD=1/250\times600=2.5\)</span> m <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^{2}\)</span>/d. The flows are initially, for a short period, high and opposite on both sides of the strip. Later on it became constant from left to right.</p>

<p>This case, in which the water level at both boundaries suddenly rises by the same amount of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> m, can also be regarded as a transient drainage after a heavy shower of rain on the strip. If we assume that the rain surplus <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P\)</span> [m] reaches the water table immediately, then the water level in the entire strip would suddenly rise by the amount <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A=\frac{P}{S_{y}}\)</span> in which <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P\)</span> is the rain (that part of it that reaches the water table) and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S_{y}\)</span> is the specific yield. Therefore, after such a shower, the head in the entire strip would suddenly be at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> m above the water level in the ditches on either side. Immediately after this shower, assumed to be of zero duration, the strip starts draining. The picture that is thus obtained is the same as that in which the ditches suddenly rise by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> m at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t=0\)</span>, be it that the drainage picture is turned upside-down. This drainage situation is illustrated in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-symmetrical-strip-draining"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 50</span></a>.</p>

<p>As can be seen from <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-head-after-sudden-rise-left-and-right"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 47</span></a>, immediately after the head change, the water table drops very fast near the edges of the strip. Very soon, however, the head takes the shape of a cosine and the strip drains gradually until its final equilibrium at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\left(x,t\rightarrow\infty\right)=0\)</span> is reached.</p>
<p>The cosine shape at later drainage stages follows from another form of analytical solution of the same strip, which will be discussed in the next section.</p>
<p>An example is shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-head-after-sudden-rise-same-at-both-sides"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 51</span></a>. In this case, the time interval between times used to show the heads is the so-called halftime as will be derived later.

<p>Here we introduce a solution for the drainage of a land strip that initially has uniform head <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\left(0,x\right)=A\)</span> and is bounded by two straight head boundaries at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x=\pm b\)</span> with head at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\left(\pm b,t\right)=0\)</span>. This solution looks completely different from the one we obtained by infinite mirroring of strips of land as we did in the previous sections, yet it provides the same result for the symmetrical case. The advantage of this form of the solution is that it can be further analyzed to deduce general drainage patterns and their time scale.</p>

<p><a class="reference internal" href="#equation-eq-kraaijenoff-van-der-leur-verruijt">Eq.19</a> looks complicated at first, but it can be broken down to yield useful and practical insights pertaining to the dynamic characteristics of draining groundwater basins. For that purpose, we analyze the expression under the summation.</p>
<p>The <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2j-1\)</span> is just the series <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1,3,5,7,\dots\)</span>. and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\left(-1\right)^{2j-1}=+1,-1,+1,-1,\dots\)</span>. Next, we have a product of a cosine and an exponent. The cosine will fluctuate between -1 and +1 and it only depends on <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>. Then notice the exponent, which only depends on time. For simplicity write it as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\exp\left[-\left(2j-1\right)^{2}\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{2}\frac{t}{T}\right]\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T=\frac{b^{2}S}{kD}\)</span>. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T\)</span> may thus be regarded as a characteristic time of the drainage. The exponent terms in the series now become</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\exp\left(-\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{2}\frac{t}{T}\right),\,\exp\left(-9\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{2}\frac{t}{T}\right),\,\exp\left(-25\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{2}\frac{t}{T}\right),\,\dots\]</div>
<p>Because <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{t}{T}&gt;0\)</span>, the second and higher terms will finally become much smaller than the first and may, therefore, be neglected when <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t&gt;t_{n}=nT\)</span> where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span> needs to be estimated. So let us see when the second term becomes much less than the first one, so that only the first term matters and we can neglect all higher terms. Therefore, compare the first term with the second and demand that it’s much larger than the second:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\exp\left(-\pi^{2}\frac{t}{T}\right)\gg\exp\left(-9\pi^{2}\frac{t}{T}\right)\]</div>
<p>or</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\exp\left(-\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{2}\frac{t}{T}\right)=G\,\exp\left(-9\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{2}\frac{t}{T}\right)\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\)</span> is just a large positive number. We may choose <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G=100\)</span>, which means, we neglect all higher terms, when the first term is at least 100 times a large as the second.</p>
<p>Taking the logarithm at both sides of the equal-sign yields</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[-\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{2}\frac{t}{T}=\ln G-9\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{2}\frac{t}{T}\]</div>
<p>Hence, we obtain</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[8\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{2}\frac{t}{T}=\ln G\]</div>
<p>so that</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\frac{t}{T}=\frac{\ln G}{8\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{2}}=\frac{\ln100}{8\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{2}}\approx0.23\]</div>
<p>This way, for the chosen value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G=100\)</span>, we find <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t=0.23T\)</span>. Therefore, we conclude that all higher terms are negligible when <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t&gt;0.23\,T\)</span>. Of course, we could also have chosen another large value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\)</span>, but the outcome would not be much different because <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\)</span> is under the logarithm.</p>
<p>This means that when <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t&gt;0.23T\)</span> the expression given above reduces to only one term</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[s\left(x,t\right)=A\frac{4}{\pi}\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\frac{x}{b}\right)\exp\left(-\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{2}\frac{t}{T}\right)\mbox{, with }t&gt;0.23T\mbox{, and }T=\frac{b^{2}S}{kD}\]</div>
<p>This is a simple-to-understand expression. It is a cosine that only depends on <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>, not on time, with its top equal to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{4}{\pi}A\)</span> in the center where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x=0\)</span> and zero where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x=\pm b\)</span>. This cosine-shaped groundwater mound gradually declines according to the exponent that only depends on time, not in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>.</p>
<p>An exponential decline can always be characterized by its so-called halftime. The halftime is the time in which the head reduces by a factor 0.5. So if <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> increases by one halftime, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta t_{50\%}\)</span>, the head <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s(x,t)\)</span> is reduced to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0.5\times s\left(x,t\right)\)</span>.</p>
<p>To obtain this halftime, just write down mathematically that half the head at time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> is obtained at time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t+\Delta t_{50\%}\)</span>. So literally</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[0.5\exp\left(-\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{2}\frac{t}{T}\right)=\exp\left(-\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{2}\frac{t+\Delta t_{50\%}}{T}\right)\]</div>
<p>Taking the logarithm on both sides yields</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\ln0.5-\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{2}\frac{t}{T}=-\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{2}\frac{t+\Delta t_{50\%}}{T}\]</div>
<p>and so</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{aligned}
\ln0.5 &amp; = &amp; -\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{2}\frac{\Delta t_{50\%}}{T}\end{aligned}\]</div>
<p>and, therefore,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\frac{\Delta t_{50\%}}{T}=\left(\frac{2}{\pi}\right)^{2}\ln2\approx0.28\]</div>
<p>or</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\Delta t_{50\%}\approx0.28T\mbox{, where }T=\frac{b^{2}S}{kD}\]</div>
<p>This implies that when time progresses by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta t_{50\%}=0.28T\)</span>, the drawdown is halved (under the condition that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t&gt;0.23T\)</span> when all higher terms can be neglected).</p>
<p>This result allows us to immediately compare the halftimes of the free drainage of groundwater basins of widely different sizes and with widely different aquifer properties. Let the size of the basin be expressed by its representative half-width <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b\)</span>. Of course, when a groundwater basin does not have has the shape of a long strip bounded by two straight canals, one should estimate a reasonable half-width based on the distance from the water divide to its drainage base, be it ditches, canals, streams, lakes, rivers or the coast.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#tbl-charactersitic-times-of-various-groundwater-basins"><span class="std std-numref">Table 1</span></a> gives the characteristic time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T=b^{2}S/kD\)</span> and the halftime <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta t_{50\%}=0.28T\)</span> for some groundwater basins. This table illustrates, that different groundwater basins that may have similar transmissivities and storage coefficients, may still have extremely large differences in half times or characteristic times. Especially the effect of the width of the basins, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b\)</span>, is large because it works to the power 2 in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T=b^{2}S/kD\)</span>. This way, a simple meadow or arable field in the Netherlands bounded between two ditches just 100 m apart may have a halftime in the order of one day, but large systems, notably deserts, like the Kalahari may have a halftime in the order o 10000 years. This implies that the small meadow in the Netherlands, will hardly remember the rain shower that fell one week ago, while the Kalahari is still draining the water that it collected during previous wet episodes may thousands of years ago, like the last ice age. Recent research with respect to the world’s largest aquifer, the Nubian sandstone, showed that this aquifer, which extends over much of Sudan, Egypt and Libya, may be regarded as a water-table aquifer that is still slowly draining the water that it collected during wet episodes when the Sahara was still wet (especially between the beginning of the Holocene era until about 4600 years ago, (Powell and Fensham 2015; Voss and Soiman 2014) and that the current oases represent the last remains of the water table reaching above ground surface, and which was much higher thousands of years ago.</p>

<p>This chapter deals with the flow to wells in aquifers. The flow to a well is treated as axially symmetric and horizontal. Vertical resistance to flow within the aquifer itself is neglected in this course. This is the so-called Dupuit-Forchheimer approximation. It is a very useful approximation because it allows computing regional groundwater flow in aquifers accurately in a vertically integrated manner by considering the flow to be horizontal (or more exactly: by neglecting the resistance to vertical flow). This way, we don’t have to deal with head losses due to vertical flow components. Important vertical components may, however, occur in the vicinity of wells that only partially penetrate the aquifer. Disturbances of the essentially horizontal flow due to partial penetration of well screens is, however, only important in the vicinity of the wells, at distances less that 1.5 times the aquifer thickness, and can be dealt with by a correction on the drawdown as will be outlined in the facultative <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-partial-penetration-of-well-screens"><span class="std std-ref">Partial penetration of well screens</span></a> (section ) .</p>
<p>We will handle more complicated situations, such as well fields and wells near specific boundaries, by superposition of mirror wells. By the way, also partial penetration is effectively handled by superposition.</p>
<p>We start this chapter with an overview of the analytical solutions that we will deal with and their related steady-state versions.</p>
<p>In the past, the actual computation of groundwater-flow solutions by looking up the values if the functions in tables. Nowadays, because everyone has access to powerful computational software like Excel or Python, we will compute the values of the different well functions using those it, rather than looking them up in tables. However, tables remain extremely important as a means to verify our own numerical implementation of solutions and functions. Further, not all required mathematical functions may be available in our actual computational program, especially not in Excel. In that case we can implement those functions ourselves. This may be done in Excel using Visual Basic. However, in the exercises of this course we’ll use the much more powerful Python language inside digital notebooks. Notice that Python is freely available and can be downloaded from the Internet. Generally, only a few lines if Python code are needed to implement and use the most important transient groundwater-flow solutions and apply superposition in time and or in space to handle more demanding situations.</p>

<p>The next three figure s provide an impression of what wells are, without entering into the details of their construction or the installation of pumps, pump cellars, electricity and so on. What matters for us, is the position of the screen inside the aquifer. There exist numerous types of wells: open wells, dug wells, drilled wells, tube wells, horizontal wells and more. In this course, we limit ourselves to wells of small radius, in which water storage inside the well-bore can be neglected. This limitation suffices for most practical situations. Many more solutions for special cases can be found in Carslaw and Jaeger (1986) and in Bruggeman (1999). With respect to well testing and pumping-test analyses there is the world-famous book Kruseman and Ridder (1970). It has been used in all continents since 1970. The second edition of this book (Kruseman and Ridder 1994), can be downloaded from the Internet for free (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.hydrology.nl/images/docs/dutch/key/Kruseman_and_De_Ridder_2000.pdf">https://www.hydrology.nl/images/docs/dutch/key/Kruseman_and_De_Ridder_2000.pdf</a>). The book is a very good reference, which covers the relevant literature on pumping-test analyses. Furthermore, it is practical and provides tables with the values for many of the analytical groundwater functions that you may ever need to check your own implementations.</p>
<p>The analytical solution for large-diameter wells, is such a special case, which is useful for situations like the one illustrated in figure . The implementation of the solution for large-diameter wells with in-bore water storage is provided in <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-large-diameter-wells"><span class="std std-ref">Large-diameter wells (not for the exam)</span></a>, just for reference, not as part of this course.</p>

<p><a class="reference internal" href="#fig-a-tube-well-unconfined"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 58</span></a> is a sketch of a (tube) well in an unconfined aquifer (“unconfined” is synonymous with“water-table aquifer” and with“phreatic aquifer”). A“confined aquifer” does not have a water table, its top is given by the bottom of an overlying layer. A semi-confined aquifer is also confined, but the layer on top is leaky, as may be this also holds for the layer at its bottom.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#fig-tube-well-confined"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 59</span></a> gives a sketch of a tube well in a (semi)-confined aquifer. The difference between a confined and a semi-confined aquifer, is that the top and bottom of the confined aquifer are both impervious (there is no vertical leakage), while the semi-confined aquifer has vertical leakage through its ceiling, its floor or both. The screen, i.e. the perforated portion of the well is considered to be fully penetrating the (wet) thickness of the aquifer, see <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-a-tube-well-unconfined"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 58</span></a>. The well’s screen is not completely penetrating the aquifer in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-tube-well-confined"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 59</span></a>. This is very often the case in practice, where well screens only partially penetrate the aquifer because this saves drilling, material and installation costs where the aquifers are much thicker than is necessary for the designed extraction rates. It should be noted however, that due to partial penetration of a well screen, the streamlines in the vicinity of the screen will no longer be all horizontal. The concentration of the streamlines towards the top and the bottom of a partially penetrating well screen causes extra head loss relative to the situation with a fully penetrating well screen. This head loss can be taken into account when necessary as outlined in the facultative <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-partial-penetration-of-well-screens"><span class="std std-ref">Partial penetration of well screens</span></a> .</p>

Of course, seepage may also occur from underlying layers. In practice we may encounter multi-aquifer systems, in which aquifers are sandwiched between semi-pervious layers. However, we will not deal with such multilayer groundwater-flow systems in this syllabus. The modern theory for multilayer aquifer systems may be looked up in (Hemker 1984, 1985; Hemker and Maas 1987) in (Hemker and Maas 1987) and in Bruggeman (1999).</p>
<p>It is important to realize that flow due to an extraction by a well in a water-table aquifer or a perfectly confined aquifer of infinite lateral extent will never reach equilibrium; it will always remain transient. The reason is that all the water has to come from storage. Or more precisely, the extraction by itself does not cause any water external to the aquifer to enter the aquifer. Even rain does not have any effect on the drawdown caused by the extraction. Of course, rain does change the head in the aquifer, but this change is completely independent of the extraction from the well. This recharge has an effect that can be superimposed independently from the that caused by the extraction. Only when a well extraction causes water to flow across aquifer boundaries as an effect of the gradients created by the well extraction, can the flow reach an equilibrium, i.e. steady state after a limited time. Therefore, a continuous extraction from a confined aquifer of infinite extent never reaches steady state, but a continuous extraction from a semi-confined aquifer does reach steady state, as does an extraction by a well in an aquifer that is bounded by some fixed-head boundaries. Of course, if the flow through the semi-confined layer drains higher-up layers or even an overlying marsh, then this steady-state situation may not be reached, or it cannot be maintained for a very long time as the overlaying swamp itself would be drained by the leakage created by the well extraction in from the aquifer below. In that case, we will see a delayed yield, which is outlined in the facultative <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-delayed-yield"><span class="std std-ref">Delayed yield (delayed water-table response)</span></a>on . In practice, it is always important to realize that extraction from a semi-confined layer may drain overlying layers such that the head in or above the overlying layer will also decline, which in turn will cause the induced leakage through the confining layer to decline and even stop entirely over time. The more the leakage declines due to the delayed drainage of overlying layers, the more the head in the aquifer will start behaving like a confined or unconfined layer without vertical leakage but with the specific yield of the overlying layer as its storage coefficient, hence the expression“delayed yield”.</p>
<p>Governing partial differential equations are important as they express the physical foundation and the approximations made to solve a problem analytically as well as numerically. They will be presented further down. However, the general relation between solutions for a water-table aquifer and a confined aquifer is presented first.</p>

<p>The transmissivity in a water-table aquifer is given by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T=kh\)</span> where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h\)</span> is the distance from the water table to the bottom of the aquifer; while in the derivation of solutions the bottom of the aquifer is assumed to be horizontal. The transmissivity of a confined aquifer is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T=kD\)</span> with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(D\)</span> its thickness and the transmissivity, which is assumed constant. In an unconfined aquifer, the thickness and head <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h\)</span> depends on distance between the water table and the bottom of the aquifer. In a water-table aquifer, the thickness does in fact vary with the water table as it changes due to the pumping, and perhaps also due to other factors like varying boundary conditions.</p>
<p>It should be noted that there exist no analytical solutions dealing with a time-variable water table; all available solutions approximate the water-table situation by taking <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(D\approx h\)</span>, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h\)</span> should be a suitable average over the area of interest.</p>
<p>To allow an analytical solution for a transient groundwater problem to be found, the governing partial differential equation is linearized before solving it. Superposition can then be applied using the solutions of the linearized partial differential equation.</p>
<p>Superposition allows us to add up an arbitrary number of different solutions to the same groundwater system in order to handle more complex situations. When the underlying governing partial differential equation is linear, the effect of individual wells remain completely separated from effects of other factors or boundary conditions. This implies that precipitation and evaporation play no role when it comes to computing the changes of the groundwater heads and flows caused by wells.</p>
<p>This simplification may fail when the groundwater system does not obey the assumptions that underlie our partial differential equation. This is the case, for example, when plant evaporation is reduced in a <strong>nonlinear</strong> fashion by the drawdown of the water table. One should keep such exceptions in mind when solving practical problems and stay aware of the limitations to the calculation methods and formulas applied. Of course, the same is true when applying groundwater models.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#tbl-overview-of-the-groundwater-well-solutions"><span class="std std-numref">Table 2</span></a> shows the most important groundwater-well solutions. Only the first one in the table deals with a water-table aquifer; all other well solutions require the transmissivity to be constant. To use these solutions for water-table aquifers, the drawdown must remain small compared to the wet aquifer thickness; it may not change by more than say 20% of the original aquifer thickness. However, one may often overcome such conditions by using a proper average for the aquifer thickness. The water-table solution in the table depends on <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h^{2}-H^{2}\)</span>. Note that this can be converted into a product of the drawdown and the aquifer thickness as follows</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-eq-h2-h2-00003d2sh">
<span class="eqno">(20)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-eq-h2-h2-00003d2sh" title="Permalink to this equation"></a></span>\[h^{2}-H^{2}=\left(h-H\right)\left(h+H\right)\approx2sH=2sD\]</div>
<p>By replacing <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h^{2}-H^{2}\)</span> in the first solution by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2sH\)</span> one obtains the second. <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-eq-h2-h2-00003d2sh">Eq.20</a> also gives a clue with respect to the accuracy of using a confined-aquifer solution for the water-table case, which we will often do in practice. It requires that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h+H\approx2D\)</span>. A head change of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h\)</span> of 20% of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H\)</span> therefore, causes an error in the computed drawdown of about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10\%\)</span>, which is acceptable under most circumstances.</p>
<p>Clearly, the second Thiem solution in the table below is directly related to the transient Theis solution, but they are not equivalent, because the Theis solution has no steady state. However, the difference between the transient heads at two finite distances from the pumping well does become steady state over time, and that steady state is equivalent to the Thiem solution for constant aquifer thickness. The steady-state solution for the flow to a well in a leaky aquifer, according to De Glee (1930) in the table, is the steady-state equivalent of the transient solution of Hantush (1955). Also notice that <strong>all</strong> steady-state solutions have a 2 in the denominator of the factor multiplying the well function or the logarithm, while <strong>all</strong> transient solutions have a 4 at that position. From this, it immediately follows that the Hantush solution for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\rightarrow\infty\)</span> is</p>

<p>In 1935, Theis (1935) published a new solution for the dynamic change of head <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\)</span> [m] caused by a well that, at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t=0\)</span>, begins pumping at a constant rate <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q\)</span> [L <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^{3}\)</span>/T] from an infinite aquifer having uniform transmissivity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(kD\)</span> [L <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^{2}\)</span>/T] and storativity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span> [-].</p>
<p>The solution by Theis has been a major breakthrough in groundwater hydrology. For the first time, it became possible to analyze the dynamics of the heads and flows caused by extracting wells. Before Theis, only steady-state flow solutions for the groundwater flow to wells existed, which very much limited possible analyses of actual pumping regimes. According to Theis, when a well pumps from an aquifer of infinite extent, all water must come from storage; there are no extra sources of the extracted water.</p>
<p>Then, 20 years layer Hantush (1955) developed an analytical solution for the flow to a well in a semi-confined aquifer. The only difference between the two being that with Hantush, the water would not only come from storage from the aquifer itself, but also from leakage through an overlying (and or an underlying) aquitard in proportion to the drawdown caused by the well. This solution also largely extended the possible cases that were amenable to analyses. Contrary to the Theis-solution, the Hantush solution does approach a steady state within a limited time. Both solutions are mathematically similar, in fact, the Theis solution is a special case of the more general Hantush solution; the Theis solution is the Hantush solution for the case that the vertical hydraulic resistance of the aquitard <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c=\frac{d}{k'}\)</span> [T] (with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d\)</span> [L] the thickness of the aquitard and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k'\)</span> [L/T] its effective vertical conductivity) is infinite. Note that the dimension of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c\)</span> is [T], i.e. time. The flow and drawdown caused by extracting from a well in an infinite aquifer must be axially symmetric. <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-pde-axial-flow-to-well"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 60</span></a> shows the general situation in cross section. A well with a well radius <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_{0}\)</span> is extracting a constant flow <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{0}\)</span> [L <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^{3}\)</span>/T]. The aquifer is semi-confined; so there is exchange of water through the overlying aquitard with resistance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c\)</span> [T] with water on top of that layer with a constant water level <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h_{0}\)</span>. All water levels or heads are with respect to an arbitrary datum (reference elevation) as indicated. The leakage at any <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span> equals <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n=\frac{h_{0}-h_{r,t}}{c}\)</span> [L/T]. The head in the aquifer is denoted by the curved lines. During the time step <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dt\)</span> the head increases from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h_{r,t}\)</span> to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h_{r,t+dt}=h_{r,t}+\frac{\partial h_{r,t}}{dt}dt\)</span>. Please watch the signs. It is clear that when we extract water from the well, the heads will decline and the flows designated in the figure are directed towards the well. However, they are drawn in the opposite direction, the direction in which <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span> is positive and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h\)</span> is positive. This facilitates somewhat the derivation, it only has an effect on where we will have minus signs.</p>

<p>This partial differential equation is valid for axial flow in a semi-confined aquifer, and therefore, also for the Hantush (leaky) situation. It should be immediately clear that for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c\rightarrow\infty\)</span>, i.e. when the aquitard becomes impervious, turns into an aquiclude, the term <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s/\lambda^{2}\)</span> drops out. This then yields the partial differential equation that is valid for the Theis situation. Hence, the Theis situation is a special case of the Hantush situation.</p>
<p>It should further be clear from this derivation that the partial differential equation is a water budget on infinitesimal scale. The left-hand side tells us how much the net flow of water is that flows into one meter of the the ring (not out of the ring, because in the last but one equation above we changed the sign), while on the right-hand side of the equal sign we have the terms that quantify where this net inflow goes. The first term to the right gives the part that flows into storage, and the second term to the right quantifies the leakage lost to the adjacent layer. With the second term on the right-hand side zero in the case of the Theis situation, all net water flow into the ring goes into storage and, vice versa, all water extracted from the ring (i.e. from the aquifer) stems from storage and only from storage.</p>

<p>In the derivation derived above, we considered a (semi-)confined aquifer, i.e. an aquifer filled to the top without a free water table. The storage coefficient, therefore is the elastic storage coefficient <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span> [-], i.e. the specific storage coefficient <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S_{s}\)</span> [1/L] multiplied by the aquifer thickness <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(D\)</span> [L]. If we substitute the specific yield <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S_{y}\)</span> [-], which is also dimensionless, for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span> [-] the partial differential equation is just as valid for a water table aquifer, under the sole condition that the thickness of the water-table aquifer may be regarded constant, just like the transmissivity in the case of a confined or semi-confined aquifer. Generally, for this assumption to be acceptable, the drawdown due to the well extraction must not be too large with respect to the thickness of the aquifer. A drawdown below 20% of the wetted thickness of a water-table aquifer usually is acceptable, especially when we apply the linearization explained in the previous section.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">7.4.3. </span>The Theis and Hantush well functions<a class="headerlink" href="#the-theis-and-hantush-well-functions" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>Now with the governing partial differential equation in place, the art is to find closed analytical solutions for specific cases that are useful to us, for instance the flow towards wells. These solutions then must fulfill both the partial differential equation and the initial conditions and the boundary conditions. A useful solution of a well would be that for which the initial head or drawdown is zero, and as boundary conditions that the head at infinity will always remain zero, while the flow through a ring with infinitesimally small radius around the well equals the constant extraction from the well. This solution was found by Theis (1935) for the Theis situation (i.e. without leakage) and by Hantush (1955) for the Hantush situation (i.e. with leakage through an aquitard from an adjacent layer with constant head).</p>
<p>The Theis solution is generally written as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[s=h-h_{0}=\frac{Q}{4\pi kD}\mbox{W}\left(u\right)\mbox{, with }u=\frac{r^{2}S}{4kDt}\]</div>
<p>in which <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mbox{W}\left(-\right)\)</span> is called Theis’ well function among hydrogeologists, see below. Note the small <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\)</span> [L] stands for change of head, while the big capital <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span> [-] is used for the storage coefficient of the aquifer.</p>
<p>As just said, the function <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mbox{W}\left(\right)\)</span> is known as Theis’ well function among hydrologists. However, mathematicians new that function long before Theis; they have a name for it, namely the exponential integral, it can be expressed as an integral</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-eq-theis-expint-representation">
<span class="eqno">(22)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-eq-theis-expint-representation" title="Permalink to this equation"></a></span>\[\mathrm{W}\left(u\right)=\mbox{expint}\left(u\right)=\mbox{E}_{1}\left(u\right)=\intop_{u}^{\infty}\frac{e^{-y}}{y}dy\]</div>
<p>This well function is given in tables in books that describe pumping test analyses like Kruseman and Ridder (1994) as well as in books with mathematical tables like the famous Abramowitz and Stegun (1972). Nowadays, this exponential integral function is readily available in software such as Python, but in Excel it has to be implemented by yourself, which may be done in Visual Basic.</p>
<p>The Hantush solution function is similar, it can be expressed as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[s=h-h_{0}=\frac{Q}{4\pi kD}\mathtt{W}_{h}\left(u,\frac{r}{\lambda}\right)\mbox{, with }u=\frac{r^{2}S}{4kDt}\mbox{ and }\lambda=\sqrt{kDc}\]</div>
<p>in which <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mbox{W}_{h}\left(\right)\)</span> is called the Hantush well function, which now depends on both <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\)</span>. Mathematically, the Hantush well function is similar to to the Theis well function, it is written as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-eq-hantush-well-function">
<span class="eqno">(23)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-eq-hantush-well-function" title="Permalink to this equation"></a></span>\[\mbox{W}_{h}\left(u,\frac{r}{\lambda}\right)=\intop_{u}^{\infty}\frac{e^{-y-\frac{\left(\frac{r}{2\lambda}\right)^{2}}{y}}}{y}dy\]</div>
<p>It is immediately clear, that when <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c\rightarrow\infty\)</span>, so that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\rightarrow\infty\)</span>, we get the Theis well function back. Hence, Theis is a special case of Hantush.</p>
<p>The conditions under which the drawdown formulas are valid are summarized as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The aquifer has uniform transmissivity and uniform storativity (either elastic storativity (or storage coefficient) when confined/semi-confined, or specific yield when phreatic). In case of a phreatic/unconfined/water-table aquifer, the drawdown should be small with respect to the aquifer thickness so that the transmissivity is not changed much.</p></li>
<li><p>The aquifer extends to infinity. In practice, this means that the aquifer extends far enough such that the drawdown is not affected by boundaries of the groundwater system.</p></li>
<li><p>The well is pumped at a constant rate from a given point in time, which is set to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t=0\)</span> in the formula.</p></li>
<li><p>The diameter of the well is small.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Mahdi Hantush, in Hantush (1955), specified the conditions under which his solution is valid:</p>
<p><em>“The non-steady drawdown distributed near a well discharging from an infinite leaky aquifer is presented. Variation of drawdown with time and distance caused by a well of constant discharge in confined sand of uniform thickness and uniform permeability is obtained. The discharge is supplied by the reduction of storage through expansion of the water and concomitant compression of the sand, and also by leakage through the confining bed. The leakage is assumed to be at a rate proportional to the drawdown at any point. Storage of water in the confining bed is neglected.”</em></p>

<p>Below we give an implementation of the Theis and Hantush well functions in Python. The Python implementation is powerful because one function call can handle millions of numbers at once.</p>
<section id="theis-well-function-exponential-integral">
<h4><span class="section-number">7.4.4.1. </span>Theis’ well function (exponential integral)<a class="headerlink" href="#theis-well-function-exponential-integral" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
<p>For the implementation in Python, we don’t have to look far because the exponential integral is the function <em>exp1</em> that is present in the Python module <em>scipy.special.</em> So just import the function from the module <em>scipy.special</em> as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">scipy.special</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">exp1</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>A comparison with the table of Kruseman and Ridder (1994) reveals that this is indeed the correct function.</p>
<p>If one prefers to use the letter <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mbox{W}\left(\cdots\right)\)</span> of this well function, we can import the function as follows</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">scipy.special</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">exp1</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">W</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We can also implement the well function by carrying out the integration ourselves. We have to do this anyway to implement the Hantush well function, which is not already available in the python scientific package.</p>
<p>For this implementation we need a function that yields the expression below the integral, which we call the kernel. Then we have to carry out the integration, which is conveniently done with the function <em>quad,</em>which is present in the module <em>scipy.integrate.</em> Finally, we make sure that the obtained function can handle input arrays of arbitrary size and shape and not just scalars, which is what makes the implementation in Python really powerful. By putting these three steps in a function by its own, we have the numerical implementation conveniently packaged for general use.</p>
<p>Here is the implementation:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">numpy</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="nn">np</span>

<span class="sd">    This turns out to be a very accurate and fast impementation, about as fast</span>
<span class="sd">    as the exp1 function form scipy.special.</span>

<span class="sd">    In fact we define three functions and finally compute the desired answer</span>
<span class="sd">    with the last one. The three functions are nicely packaged in the overall</span>

<p>As the doc string says, this implementation is extremely accurate and essentially as fast as the function<em>exp1</em> in the standard module <em>scipy.special.</em></p>

</div>
<p>This implementation is essentially the same.</p>
<p>Note the [0] in the last line. This is because <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mbox{wh}\left(\cdots\right)\)</span> returns a <em>tuple</em> with two elements, of which the second reports the accuracy. We cut that part off by selecting only the first element by [0] in the last line.</p>
<p>You now have three ways to compute the Theis well function: 1) by directly calling <em>exp1</em> from Python module <em>scipy.special</em>. 2) by using the implementation of the Theis well function above and 3) by using <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mbox{rho}=0\)</span> in the implementation of the Hantush well function as the Theis well function is a special case of the Hantush well function.</p>
<p>The Hantush well function can also be expressed as a power series. But this is beyond this current course.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">7.4.5. </span>Type-curves for the Theis and Hantush well functions<a class="headerlink" href="#type-curves-for-the-theis-and-hantush-well-functions" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>All books on groundwater pumping tests show type curves for the Theis and Hantush well function (<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-theis-hantush-type-curves"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 61</span></a>). A type curve is a graph of the the well function plotted on double logarithmic scale in a way that makes it directly comparable with an actual drawdown curve versus time on double log axes. This is done by plotting <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mbox{W}\left(u\right)\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mbox{W}_{h}\left(u,\frac{r}{\lambda}\right)\)</span> not versus <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u\)</span> but versus <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1/u\)</span> on double log axes. The logic of doing this follows form <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1/u=\frac{4kDt}{r^{2}S}\)</span>. The horizontal axis is then a constant times time, and so the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mbox{W}\left(u\right)\)</span> versus <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1/u\)</span> graph then gives a picture of drawdown versus time, which is definitely the easiest way to remember it. For the Hantush situation, we will have multiple type curves, each for a specific value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r/\lambda\)</span>. For small values of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1/u\)</span> and, therefore of, small values of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t/r^{2}\)</span>, i.e. for small <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> and large <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span>, the Hantush well function behaves like the Theis well function.</p>
<p>The type curves show that the Theis solution does not have a finite end-value; it keeps growing forever. Contrary to his, the Hantush curves all have a finite steady-state end-value, which depends on <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho=\frac{r}{\lambda}\)</span>. The higher the resistance of the aquitard, in fact the lower <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho=\frac{r}{\lambda}\)</span>, the later will the equilibrium be reached, with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho=0\)</span>, i.e. the Theis curve, being the limiting case when no equilibrium will ever be attained.</p>

<p>In the past, these type curves have always been used to compute the drawdown. For instance say we want to compute the drawdown at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r=250\)</span> m from the well after <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t=20\)</span> d of pumping at a rate of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q=1200\)</span> m<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^{3}\)</span>/d. The formula is</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[s=\frac{Q}{4\pi kD}\mbox{W}_{h}\left(u,\frac{r}{\lambda}\right),\,\,\,\,u=\frac{r^{2}S}{4kDt},\,\,\,\,\lambda=\sqrt{kDc}\]</div>
<p>Let <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(kD=600\)</span> m<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^{2}\)</span>/d, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S=0.2\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c=1200\)</span> d, we then have <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda=\sqrt{600\times1200}=850\)</span> m and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u=\frac{0.2}{4\times600}\frac{r^{2}}{t}=8.3\times10^{-5}\frac{r^{2}}{t}\)</span> then the drawdown at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r=250\)</span> m after 20 days will follow from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u=8.3\times10^{-5}\times\frac{250^{2}}{20}=0.259\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho=\frac{250}{850}=0.3\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q/\left(4\pi kD\right)=1200/(4\pi600)=0.159\)</span>, so that</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{aligned}
s &amp; =0.159\times\mbox{W}_{h}\left(0.259,0.3\right)\end{aligned}\]</div>
<p>The value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W_{h}\)</span> can now be read from the type curve for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r/\lambda=0.3\)</span>. But on the horizontal axes we have to use <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1/u=3.86\)</span>, hence <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W_{h}\left(\frac{1}{u}=3.86,\frac{r}{\lambda}=0.3\right)\approx0.6\)</span>. Hence, the drawdown at 250 m from the well 20 days after pumping started is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s=0.159\times0.6=0.95\)</span> m.</p>
<p>As demonstrated, these are quite some steps, whereby instead of reading the function value from the type-curves, it may be looked up in tables presented in books like Kruseman and Ridder (1994). Nowadays it is, of course, much easier to implement the functions in a program such as Python (or Excel) and use them. This allows to making graphs that involves many points at once and also to applying superposition easily, which by hand also requires many table look-ups.</p>

<p>We may further explore the behavior of these two well functions by showing them with a linear vertical scale and a logarithmic horizontal scale see <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-theis-and-hantush-curves-halflog-inflection-points"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 62</span></a>. Notice that the vertical axis is reversed (so the drawdown increases downward) to reflect real drawdown. This is not essential. On a half-log scale one sees that with the Theis curves, after some initial time, the drawdown starts increasing linearly with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1/u\)</span> and, hence, also with time. Each Hantush type curve reaches a maximum value after some time. A characteristic of in these Hantush curves is their inflection point. Each inflection point marks the time at which the Hantush drawdown is exactly half its final equilibrium value. The inflection point is reached for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u=\frac{\rho}{2}=\frac{r}{2\lambda}\)</span>, so <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mbox{W}_{h}\left(\frac{r}{2\lambda},\frac{r}{\lambda}\right)\)</span>. This knowledge can be used to estimate at what time this inflection point is reached at a given distance. Mathematically we have</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[u=\frac{r^{2}S}{4kDt_{50\%}}=\frac{r}{2\lambda}\]</div>
<p>and, therefore,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[t_{50\%}=\frac{rS\sqrt{kDc}}{2kD}=rS\sqrt{\frac{c}{kD}}\mbox{, with dimension }\left[\mathrm{\left[L\right]\left[-\right]\sqrt{\frac{\left[T\right]}{\left[L^{2}/T\right]}}}\right]=\mathrm{\left[T\right]}\]</div>
<p>The dimension is indeed time. On the other hand, if you have a measured drawdown curve and you recognize with some accuracy the inflection point of the drawdown on linear scale versus <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1/u\)</span> on half-log scales, you may conclude that this point is half-way the final equilibrium value. Also, if your measured drawdown curve shown no sign of inflection towards the horizontal line, then you may conclude that the drawdown is still developing according to the Theis solution and that there is no influence up to that time visible of any leakage through an aquitard above below the aquifer.</p>

<p>Next to its mathematical integral representation, the Theis well function given in <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-eq-theis-expint-representation">Eq.22</a>, the exponential integral can also be written as a power series (e.g. Kruseman and Ridder (1994)):</p>

<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\gamma=0.577216\dots\]</div>
<p>This <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gamma\)</span> is the so-called“Euler constant”. It is a fundamental mathematical constant much like <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\pi\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(e\)</span>, but only less well known.</p>
<p>This power-series form of the Theis well function allows some simplifications, which prove extremely useful in practice, because it simplifies many an analysis and provides a useful characteristic expression like the <em>radius of influence</em>.</p>
<p>Note that for sufficiently small values of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u\)</span>, all the terms with the higher powers and even the term <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u\)</span> will become negligible with respect to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ln u\)</span>. Take for instance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u=10^{-4},\,10^{-3},\,10^{-2},\,10^{-1},\,10^{0}\)</span>, then <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-\ln u=9.4,\,6.9,\,4.6,\,2.3,\,0\)</span> which should make this clear. Hence, for values of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u\)</span> less than about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10^{-1}\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-\ln u\)</span> is less than 4% of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u\)</span>. When this is the case, we may approximate the well function to just the first two terms of <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-eq-theis-power-series">Eq.24</a>:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}

<p>Hence, for small values of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u\)</span>, that is for very small values of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span> or for very large values of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span>, the Theis drawdown becomes a straight line when plotted versus <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1/u\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t/r^{2}\)</span> on a logarithmic horizontal axis. That is, the drawdown keeps increasing forever by a fixed value per log-cycle of time. Hence the extra drawdown between <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t=\tau\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t=10\tau\)</span> is the same whatever <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau\)</span> is, as long as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u\)</span> is small enough ( <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> is large enough). The Theis type-curve on half-log axes already revealed that after some time the drawdown keeps increasing linearly with the log of time, i.e. with by a constant value for every log-cycle of time.

<section id="radius-of-influence">
<h3><span class="section-number">7.4.7. </span>Radius of influence<a class="headerlink" href="#radius-of-influence" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>The Theis well function plotted versus <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t/r^{2}\)</span> clearly shows that it takes some time for the drawdown to reach a piezometer at a given distance. Therefore, we may speak of a“radius of influence”, which is dynamic, and indicates to how far from the well the drawdown is perceivable. It is often of practical importance. Clearly, we can define the radius of influence in different ways. For instance, we could say the radius of influence is the distance where the drawdown is 1 cm or, 10 cm or whatever seems appropriate. However, we could, and we do that here, opt for a more general definition. If we inspect the logarithmic approximation of the Theis well function, we see that at any given time, the drawdown is approximately a straight cone when plotted versus distance. Over time, the point of intersection of this straight cone with zero drawdown moves away from the well. It is natural to define the radius of influence to be the distance at which the straight drawdown line intersects the drawdown <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s=0\)</span>.</p>
<p>With the log-approximation of the Theis well function, the analysis is straightforward. Starting with the approximation we have</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\mbox{W}\left(u\right)\approx\ln\left(\frac{2.25kDt}{r^{2}S}\right)=0\]</div>
<p>so that for this to be true, the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\log\)</span> must be 1. So,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\frac{2.25kDt}{r^{2}S}=1\]</div>
<p>With this, we immediately obtain what may we call “<em>the radius of influence</em>”:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[r=\sqrt{\frac{2.25kDt}{S}}\]</div>
<p>It is the radius from the well at which the drawdown is still zero according to the approximate Theis well function. This radius is, therefore, proportional with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sqrt{t}\)</span>.</p>
<p>It is, obviously, also larger when the transmissivity is larger, causing the well’s influence to spread faster; and it is smaller when the storage coefficient is larger, which reduces the spreading of influence of the well. This simple expression is very practical to estimate how far the influence of a well under the conditions envisioned by Theis reaches as a function of time.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">7.4.9. </span>Relation between the transient Theis drawdown and the well-known Thiem solution for the drawdown in the steady-state situation. Time to reaching steady state.<a class="headerlink" href="#relation-between-the-transient-theis-drawdown-and-the-well-known-thiem-solution-for-the-drawdown-in-the-steady-state-situation-time-to-reaching-steady-state" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>A steady-state situation will develop after some time when we have any fixed-head boundary at some distance from the well. We can illustrate this using a negative mirror well at some distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R\)</span> from our well, which is equivalent to a straight line with a fixed head half-way and perpendicular to the line between the well and its mirror well. Superposition of these two wells yields (using the log-simplification for the Theis solution here for mathematical convenience):</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[s=s_{1}+s_{2}=\frac{Q}{4\pi kD}\ln\left(\frac{2.25kDt}{r_{1}^{2}S}\right)-\frac{Q}{4\pi kD}\ln\left(\frac{2.25kDt}{r_{2}^{2}S}\right)\]</div>
<p>For the drawdown in the well, we have <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_{1}=r_{w}\)</span>, the well’s radius, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_{2}=R\)</span>, hence</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
s &amp; =\frac{Q}{4\pi kD}\ln\left(\frac{R^{2}}{r_{w}^{2}}\right)\\
 &amp; =\frac{Q}{2\pi kD}\ln\left(\frac{R}{r_{w}}\right)\end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>So if there is a fixed-head boundary somewhere, which in this case we created by putting a mirror well with opposite sign at distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R\)</span>, this is equivalent to a well at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r=R/2\)</span> from a fully penetrating river. Adding a mirror well with opposite sign and the same absolute pumping rate, therefore, causes the drawdown to become constant after some time. This is true because the logarithmic approximation will always be valid after sufficiently long times. Also notice that the square under the logarithm leads to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2\pi kD\)</span> (steady) instead of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(4\pi kD\)</span> (transient) in the numerator of the factor in front of the logarithm. This is always the case in steady-state solutions for wells.</p>
<p>To determine after how much time the steady state is effectively reached is the same as determining after how much time the logarithmic simplification of the well function is valid over the distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R\)</span>. We may say as shown in before in <a class="reference internal" href="#subsec-power-approximation-of-theis-well-function"><span class="std std-ref">Power approximation of Theis well function</span></a> that this is the case when <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u_{t,R}&lt;0.1\)</span>. If we have for instance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(kD=600\)</span> m<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^{2}\)</span>/d and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S=0.2\)</span>, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R=200\)</span> m, then the time at which the steady state may be set to be effectively reached could be be estimated from</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
\frac{R^{2}S}{4kDt} &amp; =0.1\\
t &amp; =\frac{1}{0.4}\frac{R^{2}S}{kD}=\frac{100^{2}\times0.2}{0.4\times600}=8.3d\end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>However, the choice of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u=0.1\)</span> is arbitrary. Another also valid approach is through the argument at the steady state can only be reached after the<em>radius of influence</em> has reached the mirror well. This approach gives</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[R=\sqrt{\frac{2.25kD}{S}t}\rightarrow t_{ss}=\frac{R^{2}S}{2.25kD}=\frac{100^{2}\times0.2}{2.25\times600}=1.5d\]</div>
<p>From <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-drawdown-vs-log-r-radius-of-influence"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 63</span></a> it may be concluded that the time to reach steady state is, in fact, longer than the time for the radius of influence to reach the mirror well, about 3 times as much seems a better value, which then yields 4.5 days. The best way would be to look at the Theis drawdown on linear scale versus 1/u on log-scale (see <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-theis-and-hantush-curves-halflog-inflection-points"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 62</span></a>) to find that the drawdown on this graph as become straight at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1/u\approx10\)</span> which is the same as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u\approx0.1\)</span>, which is the same as our first estimate in this section and, therefore yields the best estimate for reaching the steady-state situation in this case. In conclusion, because the transition from transient to steady state is continuous, there is not exact point at which the steady state can be said to commence, but it is well possible to give a useful, well informed, quantitative estimate.</p>

<h4><span class="section-number">7.4.10.1. </span>Theis situation<a class="headerlink" href="#theis-situation" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
<p>How much water is released from storage between two distances <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_{1}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_{2}\)</span>? How much is the flow toward the well at distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span>? For such type of questions we need the flow in the aquifer at distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span>. For the Theis situation, we can determine this flow analytically, by taking the derivative of the drawdown with respect to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span>. The derivation goes as follows</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[s=\frac{Q_{0}}{4\pi kD}\mathtt{\mbox{W}}\left(u\right)\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
Q_{r} &amp; = &amp; -2\pi rkD\frac{\partial s}{\partial r}\\
Q_{r} &amp; = &amp; -\left(2\pi rkD\right)\frac{\partial\left(\frac{Q_{0}}{4\pi kD}\mbox{W}\left(u\right)\right)}{\partial r}\\
 &amp; = &amp; -\frac{2\pi krD}{4\pi kD}Q_{0}\frac{d\mbox{W}\left(u\right)}{du}\frac{\partial u}{\partial r}\end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>so that</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\frac{Q_{r}}{Q_{0}}=-\frac{r}{2}\frac{d\mbox{W}\left(u\right)}{du}\frac{\partial u}{\partial r}\]</div>
<p>With <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u=r^{2}S/\left(4kDt\right)\)</span> it follows that</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\frac{\partial u}{\partial r}=\frac{2rS}{4kDt}=\frac{2}{r}\frac{r^{2}S}{4kDt}=\frac{2u}{r}\]</div>
<p>hence</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{aligned}
\frac{Q_{r}}{Q_{0}} &amp; = &amp; -u\frac{d\mbox{W}\left(u\right)}{du}\end{aligned}\]</div>
<p>Using the mathematical expression for the well function, we have</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
\frac{Q_{r}}{Q_{0}} &amp; = &amp; -u\frac{d}{du}\left(\intop_{u}^{\infty}\frac{e^{-y}}{y}dy\right)\\
 &amp; = &amp; +u\frac{e^{-u}}{u}\end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>So, finally, we obtain the simple analytical expression</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-eq-q-as-function-of-r-1">
<span class="eqno">(25)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-eq-q-as-function-of-r-1" title="Permalink to this equation"></a></span>\[\begin{aligned}
\frac{Q_{r}}{Q_{0}} &amp; = &amp; e^{-u}\end{aligned}\]</div>
<p>or</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\frac{Q_{r}}{Q_{0}}=\exp\left(-\frac{r^{2}S}{4kDt}\right)\]</div>
<p>This is a very simple relationship between the flow <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{r}\)</span> at distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span> and time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> and the constant extraction <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{0}\)</span> from the well. Because <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u\)</span> is proportional to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r^{2}\)</span>, this ratio diminishes exponentially with the distance from the well. This means that the water comes from storage for say 99% within a given radius from the well. This radius is extending dynamically. Because <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u\)</span> is proportional to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1/t\)</span>, it means that the ratio goes to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1\)</span> within increasing time over any distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span>. This implies that the flow becomes essentially steady, i.e. reaches for instance 99% of the total extraction rate within a given radius after a certain time. Within that radius, the discharge towards the well is essentially equal to the extraction from the well. Hence, over time, the water comes from the storage further and further from the well and the contribution from the zone closer to the well declines to zero over time. Although the drawdown will never become steady state in the Theis situation, the discharge at any fixed distance from the well does become essentially steady state (will approach the well extraction more and more over time).</p>
<p>A constant discharge equal to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{0}\)</span> within a certain distance implies that the gradients will also become constant within the same distance. This in turn implies that the difference between the drawdowns in observation wells will also become constant and equal to the differences between the heads in these piezometers in the steady-state case, although this steady-state case is never reached. This implies that for sufficiently large times, we can then interpret the transient pumping test like we interpret a steady-state one, but based on the head differences between observation wells. Clearly, this requires the presence of sufficient observation. And, of course, one cannot obtain a storage coefficient from a steady-state analyses.</p>
<p>By way of example, the drawdown and the accompanying ratio <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{r}/Q_{0}\)</span> in <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-eq-q-as-function-of-r-1">Eq.25</a> is shown graphically in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-qr-over-q0"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 64</span></a> firstly as a function of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> for different values of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span>. Of course, all curves would coincide to a single line if plotted versus <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t/r^{2}\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1/u\)</span> (not shown). The figures <a class="reference external" href="#fig:Qr-over-Q0">6.9</a> emphasize the delay occurring with distance from the well (but realize that the time axis is logarithmic). All graphs look the same, except for the delay. Also, notice that once the drawdown becomes a straight line versus log time, the gradients with respect to distance will be constant. This implies that by then, the ratio <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{r}/Q_{0}\)</span> should have asymptotically approached the value of 1. This is easily verified by laying a ruler along the declining branches of the darwdown curves (top chart) and verify from what point in time these curves have become straight lines, and compare this with the extent by which the graph of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{r}/Q_{0}\)</span> (bottom chart <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-qr-over-q0"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 64</span></a>) has approached the value of 1.</p>

<p>A very important usage of the Theis and Hantush well function is the determination of the aquifer parameters from the drawdowns determined in a pumping test. This section shows such analyses for both the Theis and the Hantush case using artificial data with added noise. The artificial data allow a close comparison between the two situations. The approximate Theis solution (logarithmic) from allows exploiting the behavior of the drawdown on linear scale as a function of the log time and log <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t/r^{2}\)</span>. It allows to always compute the transmissivity of the aquifer accurately wherever this drawdown is clearly linear. This is also valid for the Hantush case, because the Hantush drawdown initially follows the Theis drawdown often yielding a nice straight line for early times in well close to the well or from water level measurements inside the well itself.</p>
<p>We will first analyze the pumping test in the Theis situation using the simplified logarithmic well function and then proceed with the classical pumping test analyses on double logarithmic axes. That analysis works the same for the Theis and the Hantush situation. The classic Hantush analysis suffers from the noise in the data. However we overcome this by taking advantage of the mentioned straightforward determination of the transmissivity first, allowing a much better end result.</p>
<p>The considered situation is as shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-situation-of-the-hantush-pumping-test"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 66</span></a>, which shows a 20 m long well screen penetrating the top 20 m of a 60 m thick aquifer covered by a (semi-)confining layer. Piezometers are present with short screens at two depth, i.e. 10 m and 50 m above the bottom of the aquifer and at 6 distances. The extraction is 2400 m<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^{3}\)</span>/d.</p>

<p>The logarithmic approximation of the Theis well function that was derived in <a class="reference internal" href="#subsec-power-approximation-of-theis-well-function"><span class="std std-ref">Power approximation of Theis well function</span></a> helps enormously with the interpretation of the measured transient drawdowns. We just have to put the drawdown in a graph with the drawdown vertically on a linear axis and the time horizontally on a logarithmic axis. The drawdown in the Theis situation then manifests itself by a linear increase with the log of time. The formula for the Theis drawdown is</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
s &amp; =\frac{Q}{4\pi kD}\mbox{W}\left(u\right)\\
 &amp; \approx\frac{Q}{4\pi kD}\ln\left(\frac{2.25kD}{S}\frac{t}{r^{2}}\right)\end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Now see what the increase of the drawdown between <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t=\tau\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t=10\tau\)</span> for any time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
s_{10\tau}-s_{\tau} &amp; =\frac{Q}{4\pi kD}\left[\ln\left(\frac{2.25kD}{S}\frac{10\tau}{r^{2}}\right)-\ln\left(\frac{2.25kD}{S}\frac{\tau}{r^{2}}\right)\right]\\
 &amp; =\frac{Q}{4\pi kD}\ln\left(10\right)\\
 &amp; =\frac{2.3Q}{4\pi kD}\end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>and, therefore,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[kD=\frac{2.3Q}{4\pi\left(s_{10t}-s_{t}\right)}\]</div>
<p>Knowing the well extraction <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q\)</span> and reading the increase of the drawdown over one log-cycle form the drawdown graph over a portion of the curve where it declines linearly versus log time, then uniquely yields the transmissivity of the aquifer. Hence, it does not matter where the drawdown is measured, in the well itself or in an observation well, as long as we get a linear drawdown per log-cycle, we will thus obtain the aquifer transmissivty. Well clogging, partial penetration (see <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-partial-penetration-of-well-screens"><span class="std std-ref">Partial penetration of well screens</span></a> ) and any other objections simply play no role here; we only need the drawdown increase per log-cycle where the drawdown increases linearly with log time. This is the simplest an probably the most robust way to determine an aquifer’s transmissivity. And it hold both for the Theis and the Hantush situation.</p>
<p>To what extent is it now also possible to determine the storage coefficient of the aquifer?</p>
<p>In theory it looks easy, but in practice there are complications. Let’s do the theory first and, by the previous analysis we now already know the transmissivity. Given the approximation of the Theis well function, when will the drawdown be zero? The answer is simple, as it is the argument of the logarithm that then must be 1. So we have zero drawdown when</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[s=0\rightarrow\frac{2.25kD}{S}\frac{t_{0}}{r^{2}}=1\]</div>
<p>Therefore,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[S=2.25kD\frac{t_{0}}{r^{2}}\]</div>
<p>We find the time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t_{0}\)</span> by extending the straight portion of the drawdown to where it intersects the horizontal line <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s=0\)</span>. Now with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t_{0}\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(kD\)</span> and the distance to the well <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span> known, we obtain the storage coefficient from the last expression.</p>
<p>But there are some complications.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>When the well screen only partially penetrates the aquifer, the drawdown in piezometers less than about 1.5 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(D\)</span> from the pumping well may suffer from additional drawdown due to the contraction of stream lines near the screen. This effect may even be negative for piezometer screens near the well but well below or above the well screen. The extra drawdown is especially present inside the pumping well if its screen only partially penetrates the aquifer. Therefore, where partial penetration plays a role, the measured drawdown does not reflect the theoretical drawdown that we based our formula on (i.e. the fully penetrating case). And so, simply reading the time where the darwdown line intersects <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s=0\)</span> would not reflect the right value. This can be corrected somewhat by taking partial penetration into account, but only to a limited amount because of unknown vertical conductivity which likely differs from the horizontal one and will vary likely also with depth.</p></li>
<li><p>The second complication is that we will not get the correct value if we measure only in the pumping well. Even though we know its radius and even if we know that its screen is fully penetrating the aquifer, the screen may be clogged to some extent. We have no way to estimate this by only measuring the declining head in the well. Therefore, we cannot reasonably expect to obtain a correct value for the time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t_{0}\)</span> this way. To circumvent complications by clogging of the screen of the pumping well, we must use separate observation wells of which the drawdown is not impacted by potential clogging of their screen nor by partial penetration of the well screen. Therefore, these observation wells should preferably be at least 1.5D away from the well. It is, of course, best to have several observation wells, so that one can verify to what extent each of them yields the same result for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In conclusion, use of the logarithmic approximation of the Theis well function is robust and effective to uniquely determine the transmissivity of the aquifer, provided the linear drawdown versus log time increases linearly. However, its use to also determine the storage coefficient is limited in practice due to the fact that at small distances from a partially penetrating well screens the obtained drawdown diverts from the theoretical one. Moreover, inside the pumping well we have an unknown extra drawdown due to its clogging, which makes invalidates the drawdown measured in the well for determination of the storage coefficient even if it were fully penetrating the aquifer. It is best to have more than one separate observation wells at sufficient distance from the pumping well, but in that case we can just as well use other analysis methods.</p>

<p>The data for the situation shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-situation-of-the-hantush-pumping-test"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 66</span></a> are presented in figure are from a pumping test with extraction <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q=2400\)</span> m<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^{3}\)</span>/d in a confined aquifer. The data are shown with the drawdown increasing downward. The second chart in the same figure shows the same data versus the log of time. All lines then become straight, declining lines (increasing drawdown) after some initial time, depending on the distance of the piezometer to the well. When this happens, one is sure that the situation that the situation complies with the one that Theis had in mind. As is seen from the lines, all lines finally have the same increase of drawdown per log-cycle. Hence, it does not matter which piezometer or even the water level in the well itself is used to determine the transmissivity. The drawdown per log-cycle is here about 0.49 m as shown by the yellow lines in the middle chart of <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-pumping-test-data"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 67</span></a>.

<p>Next, we can read the time at which the extended straight portions of the drawdown graphs intersect the line <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s=0\)</span>, zero-drawdown. This is the intersection of the yellow lines in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-pumping-test-data"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 67</span></a> middle chart with the line <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dd=0\)</span>. The times for the 4 yellow lines that intersect the line dd=0 in the figure are <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(7.5\times10^{-4}\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1.5\times10^{-3}\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(7.0\times10^{-3}\)</span>, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3.0\times10^{-2}\)</span> days for the orange, green and red lines respectively at 30, 60, 120 and 240 m from the well. Applying</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[S=2.25kD\frac{t_{0}}{r^{2}}\]</div>
<p>yields <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S=1.7\times10^{-3}\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0.8\times10^{-4}\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1.0\times10^{-3}\)</span>, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1.0\times10^{-3}\)</span> respectively. The difference between the first and the rest may be due to the accuracy with which the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t_{0}\)</span> is read from the graph. It could also result from heterogeneity in the aquifer. However, in this case, a much more important cause will be partial penetration of the well screen due to which the drawdown in piezometers closer than about 1.5D from the well differ from the theoretical value that is valid for a fully penetrating well screen.</p>
<p>The most direct way to verify this is by not plotting the drawdown versus <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\log(t)\)</span> but rather versus <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\log(t/r^{2})\)</span> because this is what the drawdown really depends on. Therefore, plotting the linear drawdown versus <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\log(t/r^{2})\)</span> should force all the drawdown curves to fall on a single one, unless other factors matter, such as partial penetration.</p>
<p>The result is shown in the bottom chart of <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-pumping-test-data"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 67</span></a>. All the curves for the piezometers that are farther then 60 m away from the well now fall on top of each other. Due to partial penetration, this is not the case for the drawdowns of piezometers that are nearer to the well. The piezometers close to the well (with their screen at 50 m elevation) have a higher than expected drawdown due to concentration of stream lines. The piezometers at the same distance with the screen far below the well face (with screen at 10 m elevation) have a lower than expected drawdown, because the streamlines in this region of the aquifer divert instead of concentrate (see <a class="reference external" href="#fig:Partial-penetrating-screens">6.28</a> ).</p>
<p>The effect of partial penetration is most extreme at the well face. Moreover, the water level in the well itself usually has an extra drawdown even above the effect of partial penetration, which is due to combined clogging of the borehole face and the well face.</p>
<p>If the position of the well screen and the aquifer thickness are known (and also the vertical anisotropy of the aquifer) then is it possible to take partial penetration into account, but this does not work for the drawdown determined in the well itself, because of potential clogging, which requires extra independent information to determine.</p>

Also, the same orange dashed lines are plotted that were before used to determine the drawdown per log-cycle in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-pumping-test-data"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 67</span></a>. The first thing we see is that now the drawdown will go towards a constant equilibrium value. The blue, red and green lines still yield a correct straight portion that allows computing the drawdown per log-cycle, but the black (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r=60\)</span> m), purple (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r=120\)</span> m) and cyan (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r=240\)</span> m) lines do not. This implies that the trick to determine the transmissivity from the straight increase of the drawdown, i.e. the portion of the drawdown for which the system still behaves like a Theis case, will work, but only for piezometers very close to the well and the well itself. But for larger distances, the previous method fails in the Hantush case.</p>
<p>We’ve seen another property of the Hantush drawdown before, which is the inflection point. If the duration of the pumping test is sufficiently long, so that one can clearly estimate the inflection point, it could be exploited. At the inflection point we have</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
u &amp; =\frac{r^{2}S}{4kDt}=\frac{r}{2\lambda}\\
\frac{S}{2}\sqrt{\frac{c}{kD}} &amp; =\frac{t}{r}\end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Although for each inflection point we know <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t/r\)</span>, and because we can determine the transmissivity from the drawdown per log-cycle, we are still left with two unknowns in this equation. Therefore, we need a better and more robust interpretation of the pumping test. This is the classical method, which uses the drawdown versus <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t/r^{2}\)</span> on double-logarithmic scales.</p>

The top chart shows the drawdown versus <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\log t\)</span>. The middle chart shows the drawdown versus <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t/r^{2}\)</span>. We expect that all lines over the portion that the drawdown still behaves according to the Theis case would fall on one single line, while at later times the lines will deviate from the Theis curve as they approach the Hantush equilibrium. The graph shows that this only works for piezometers further away from the well, here for those least 60 m from the well. This is clear from the curves, which show that at distances larger than 60 m the drawdown in the to and the bottom of the aquifer are the same (See lines with the same color in the charts). The reason is, of course, the impact of partial penetration on the drawdown. Due to partial penetration, the piezometers at 50 m above the base of the aquifer, opposite the well face (at 40-60 m) over-estimate the drawdown. On the other hand, the piezometers at 10 m above the bottom of the aquifer, i.e. far below the bottom of the well, under-estimate the drawdown. The closer to the well, the more extreme this over- en underestimation is. The drawdown in the well itself (almost 10 m!) is further increased by clogging. For our interpretation we have to leave these piezometers out. Therefore we’ll limit our analysis to the piezometers at 60, 120 and 240 m from the well.

<p><span class="caption-number">Fig. 74 </span><span class="caption-text">Two overlapping sheets.

</div>
<p>To interpret the pumping test, we will overlay the measurements with the Hantush type-curves plotted on a different sheet of paper but making sure that the width of the log-cycles both vertically and horizontally are the same as of the double-log graph of the measurements, where drawdown <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dd\)</span> was plotted against <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t/r^{2}\)</span>. This is shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-hantush-pumping-test-two-overlapping-sheets"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 74</span></a>.</p>
<p>Because we use double log paper, the type curves should have exactly the same shape as the measurements. The reason is that the drawdown is obtained by multiplying the well function by a constant (i.e. the as yet unknown value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q/\left(4\pi kD\right)\)</span>, and multiplying by a constant is done by shifting by a constant on log-scale. Further, because <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1/u=\frac{4kD}{S}\times\frac{t}{r^{2}}\)</span>, the horizontal axis of the graph of the measurements and that of the type-curves also differ by a factor (the as yet unknown value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{4kD}{S}\)</span>. On log-scale this implies a horizontal shift of the two axes relative to each other. But in any case, the shape of the measurement curves should be exactly that of the type curves.</p>
<p>Therefore, when we have the measurements and the type curves on two separate sheets of paper such that the size of each log-cycle both horizontally and vertically are the same in both graphics, then we can overlay them and shift them with respect to each other such that the measurements and the type-curves match as well as possible.</p>
<p>Once we have this, we choose an arbitrary point (just prick a pin at that point through both sheets of paper) and call it the match point (I chose the big dot in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-hantush-pumping-test-two-overlapping-sheets"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 74</span></a>). Then read the value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t/r^{2}\)</span> for the match point from the measurement sheet. This yields <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t/r^{2}=1.37\times10^{-5}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s=0.137\)</span>. Next, read the value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Wh\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1/u\)</span> for the match point from the sheet with the type-curves. This yields <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1/u=100\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mbox{Wh}=1\)</span>.</p>
<p>With these data compute the transmissivity and the storage coefficient.</p>
<p>First we focus on the vertical axes of the two charts using the values of the match point, for which we obtain:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
s &amp; =\frac{Q}{4\pi kD}\mbox{Wh}\\
0.137 &amp; =\frac{2400}{2\pi kD}1\\
kD &amp; =2800\end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Next, we focus on the horizontal axis, for which we have:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{u} &amp; =4\frac{kD}{S}\frac{t}{r^{2}}\\
200 &amp; =4\times\frac{kD}{S}1.37\times10^{-5}\\
\frac{kD}{S} &amp; =3.64\times10^{6}\\
S &amp; =8\times10^{-3}\end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>The resistance of the aquitard then follows from which line of the Hantush type curves actually fits the measurements.</p>
<p>For <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r=60\)</span> m we find the type curve for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r/\lambda=0.2\)</span>, for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r=120\)</span> m we it is the type curve for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r/\lambda=0.3\)</span> and for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r=240\)</span> m it is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r/\lambda=0.5\)</span>. Hence, the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\)</span>-values that we find are <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(60/0.2=300\)</span> m, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(120/0.3\)</span> = 400 m and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(240/0.5\)</span>=480 m. So it must be around 400 m. The aquitard resistance then becomes <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c=\lambda^{2}/kD=400^{2}/2800=60\)</span> d.</p>
<p>This is the classical pumping test analysis. It works the same for Theis and Hantush. However, for Hantush we will also find the values of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r/\lambda\)</span> and, therefore, of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\)</span>, which in turn yields the resistance of the aquitard when we have already determined the transmissivity of the aquifer.</p>
<section id="can-we-improve-the-accuracy">
<h4><span class="section-number">7.5.3.1. </span>Can we improve the accuracy?<a class="headerlink" href="#can-we-improve-the-accuracy" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
<p>Yet in this case, the interpretation does not seem to be very accurate as the three <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\)</span> values are not very consistent. This is a consequence of the noise in the data. Can we do better? Remember that we may always determine the transmissivity from the drawdown per log-cycle, which is independent of partial penetration. We only need drawdown that has a sufficiently long straight portion on half-log scale. It is likely that the drawdowns close to the well and that inside the well itself will exhibit such an opportunity. <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-pumping-test-data-hantus"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 70</span></a> shows that this is indeed the case for the drawdown at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z=50\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r=10\)</span>, which yields a drawdown per log-cycle of 0.49 m and so we have</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[kD=\frac{2.3Q}{4\pi\left(s_{10t}-s_{t}\right)}=\frac{2.3\times2400}{4\,\pi\,0.49}\approx900\,[m^{2}/d]\]</div>
<p>With the transmissivity known accurately, we also know the vertical shift of the two vertical axes required to let the Hantush-type curves overlap the data. This would be</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[s=\frac{Q}{4\pi kD}\mbox{W}_{h}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q/\left(4\pi kD\right)=2400/(4\pi900)=0.212\)</span>. Therefore, we obtain</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[s=0.212\mbox{W}_{h}\]</div>
<p>With respect to the horizontal axes we have</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
1/u &amp; =\frac{4kD}{S}\frac{t}{r^{2}}\\
1/u &amp; =\frac{4\times900}{S}\frac{t}{r^{2}}\\

<p>In which <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span> is the only remaining unknown. Hence, by changing <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span> by trial and error in <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-eq-drawdown-various-s-values">Eq.26</a>, we can now shift the computed Theis drawdown horizontally such that it matches the data as well as possible. The results are shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-hantush-ptest-measurements-overlapped-for-best-s"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 75</span></a>, top chart. The computed Theis line that best fits the data is make thicker an dashed red. With the transmissivity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(kD=900\)</span> m<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^{2}\)</span>/d and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S=0.008\)</span> now secured, we can overlap the measurements with the lines computed using the Hantush well function for a suitable set of values for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho=r/\lambda\)</span>. The results are shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-hantush-ptest-measurements-overlapped-for-best-s"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 75</span></a>, bottom chart. This final chart allows us to select the best values for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r/\lambda\)</span> for the three observation distances. We thus find <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho\approx0.17\)</span> for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r=60\)</span> m, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho\approx0.32\)</span> for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r=120\)</span> m and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\approx0.7\)</span> for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r=240\)</span> m. And so we have three approximations for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\)</span>= <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r/\rho\)</span> namely <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(60/0.17=353\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(120/0.32=375\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(240/0.7=343\)</span> m, hence, consistent results with an average value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\approx360\)</span> m from which we obtain <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c=\lambda^{2}/kD=360^{2}/900=145\)</span> m.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have interpreted the pumping test in a classical fashion, making use of the fact that the type curves and the measurements must have the exact same form on double log axes, under the conditions that there is no effect of partial penetration. We have experienced that the results may be less exact due to the presence of noise in the data resulting from phenomena like weather and barometer pressure fluctuations that have nothing to do with our pumping test, but can not be avoided in practice when pumping tests last for several days or weeks. Despite the difficulties resulting from this noise, we were able to take advantage of the universal fact that the transmissivity can be obtained uniquely and accurately from the straight portion of the drawdown when plotted versus the log <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span>, irrespective of partial penetration or even clogging of the well in case we measure the water level inside the well. This is also due to the fact that even in a semi-confined Hantush situation, the observation points close to the well still show a consistent Theis behavior at early times, allowing to extract a straight portion of the drawdown curves versus log <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> . With the transmissivity thus known accurately, we know the vertical shift of the measurement chart relative to the chart with the type curves, so that the charts only have to be shifted horizontally to find the best fit. This particular exercise was done in the computer, by plotting the Theis drawdown curves for a range of storage coefficients directly on the measurement chart, which allowed us to pick the one that best fits the data. With then both the transmissivity and the storage coefficient fixed, we could overlap the measurements with a bundle of Hantush computed drawdowns, for a range of values for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho=\frac{r}{\lambda}\)</span>. This allowed us to pick the best fitting <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r/\lambda\)</span> for the measurements of the piezometers at different larger distances from the well. As a result, we obtained an <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r/\lambda\)</span> value for each of the three piezometer distances, which in turn yielded three mutually consistent values for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\)</span>. The average of these, combined with the transmissivty finally gave us the hydraulic resistance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c\)</span> of the aquitard. The final results are accurate and fully consistent with the data.</p>

<li><p>Groundwater is extracted from an unconfined aquifer to irrigate crops by means of a pivot, i.e. a well connected to an irrigation frame that slowly turn around the well. This pivot irrigates a disc of a surface are of 50 ha. 50% of the irrigated waters is consumed by the crop and hence evaporated by it; the remaining 50% is water that returns to the aquifer. A crop consumes a water volume equivalent to a layer of 75 cm over the area served. Two crops can be harvested each year. What is the required pumping capacity of the well and how will the groundwater head below the pivot develop? To answer this question, compute the drawdown over time at the following distances from the well a) 0.2 m (=inside the well, required to see if the well could fall dry in the near future), b) at the edge of the irrigated 50ha circular area served by the well, c) at 2 and 5 times this radius to estimate its impact on neighboring wells.</p></li>
<li><p>An area in Morocco is irrigated by means of drainage tunnels (qanats, or khettarras, see Wikipedia, see <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-qanats-new-development"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 78</span></a>). The water to the aquifer is rainwater that was captured in the nearby hills and mountains. The general groundwater flow away from the foot of the mountains causes a gradient of the natural groundwater, which is exploited by the drainage tunnels. These tunnels run from their downstream outlet in the villages with a small upward gradient towards the foot of the mountains, where they intersect the water table, so that groundwater will drain and flow towards the village through these tunnels. Assume that the average drawdown caused by these tunnels is 2 m. A developer intends develop a farm to grow crops in a new area nearby and wants to install wells for irrigation. The area to be irrigated is 50 ha and the required net consumption is 0.75 m/year, hence a required year-average extraction of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0.75\times50000/365=1030\mathrm{m^{3}/y}\)</span>. What will be the impact of the extraction wells on the existing khettaras? Take into consideration that the aquifer at the foot of the mountains is closed and that its open to infinity away from these mountains. Assume the specific yield is 20% and the transmissivity is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(500\,\mathrm{m^{2}/d}\)</span>. Realize that there are no fixed-head boundaries, i.e. the groundwater will always be in dynamic equilibrium. So the effect of the new development will also be transient. Compute the drawdown that it causes over time in the drainage area of the qanats. Realize that the mountain face works as a groundwater barrier.</p></li>

<li><p>Som thoughts about the problem stated above. It may not seem immediately obvious to provide an answer with the simple tools of this course. But we can give it a try. We can compute the transient drawdown by the new well compute its effect near the foot of the mountains. With this, we can compute the drawdown everywhere, and therefore, also at every point of the qanats where they tap the groundwater, which is in the qanat drainage area. We may assume that the yield of the qanats is proportional to the drawdown they cause, which was 2 m. When we subtract the drawdown of the new well at the khettaras from that of the khettaras themselves, we have at least an estimate of the impact. A difficulty arises only from the integration of the drawdown impact along each khettara. However, we can just take the drawdown that the center of their tapping length as an approximation.</p></li>

<h3><span class="section-number">7.5.5. </span>Superposition in time<a class="headerlink" href="#superposition-in-time" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>We will illustrate superposition in time for the Theis situation, however, it works exactly the same for the Hantush case.</p>
<p>A well may be switched on and off at will. The effect of this switching can be taken into account by superposition. For instance, a well that has been pumping for a time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta t_{i}\)</span> since <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t=0\)</span>, after which it is switched off, can be viewed as two wells that pump continuously. The first starts at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t_{0}=0\)</span> with extraction <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{0}\)</span> and the second at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t=t_{0}+\Delta t_{i}\)</span> with extraction <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-Q_{0}\)</span>. This way, the net extraction will be zero for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t&gt;t_{0}+\Delta t\)</span>. This superposition can be applied with a large number of changes of the flow rate at arbitrary times. The problem may only be that after many such changes one needs to carry on a large number of“wells” at the location of the real well to compute the current state. This is merely a computational burden, one that can be effectively dealt with through application of convolution, explained elsewhere in this syllabus.</p>
<p>Hence, we have for a well that switches on at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t=t_{0}\)</span> and then switches off at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t=t_{0}+\Delta t\)</span></p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[s_{t}=\frac{Q_{0}}{4\pi kD}\mbox{W}\left(u_{t-t_{0}}\right)-\frac{Q_{0}}{4\pi kD}\mbox{W}\left(u_{t-\left(t+\Delta t\right)}\right)\]</div>
<p>where the second term is omitted al long as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t&lt;t_{0}+\Delta t\)</span>.</p>
<p>To deal with a well with varying extraction, we subdivide time in episodes during which the extraction from the well may be considered sufficiently constant. In this superposition we start a new well at the same position each time the flow rate changes. We let this new well extract the difference between the new rate and that of the previous well.</p>
<p>For example, let the flow rate change at rate-change times <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t_{0},t_{1},t_{2},t_{3},\dots\)</span> after which the flow rate is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{0},Q_{1},Q_{2},Q_{3},\dots\)</span>, respectively. We can simulate the heads by starting a new well at each of these rate-change times with extraction</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[Q_{0},\,Q_{1}-Q_{0},\,Q_{2}-Q_{1},\,Q_{3}-Q_{2},\dots\]</div>
<p>because after <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t_{0}\)</span> the total extraction is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{0}\)</span>, after <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t_{1}\)</span> ti is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{0}+Q_{1}-Q_{0}=Q_{1}\)</span>, after <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t_{2}\)</span> it is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{1}+Q_{2}-Q_{1}=Q_{2}\)</span> etc. Applying superposition then yields</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[s_{t}=\frac{Q_{0}}{4\pi kD}\mbox{W}\left(u_{t-t_{0}}\right)_{t&gt;t_{0}}+\frac{Q_{1}-Q_{0}}{4\pi kD}\mbox{W}\left(u_{t-t_{1}}\right)_{t\ge t_{1}}+\frac{Q_{2}-Q_{1}}{4\pi kD}\mbox{W}\left(u_{t-t_{2}}\right)_{t\ge t_{2}}+\frac{Q_{3}-Q_{2}}{4\pi kD}\mbox{W}\left(u_{t-t_{3}}\right)_{t\ge t_{3}}+\dots\]</div>
<p>To check, take any time, say <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t_{i}\)</span> so that all wells <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0\rightarrow i\)</span> are active and add all the flows for these well to get <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{i}\)</span> which is the true total extraction at that time.</p>
<p>With this in mind, superposition for an arbitrarily varying well becomes straightforward. Just assemble the list <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t_{i}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{i}\)</span> for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i=0\rightarrow n\)</span>. The flow of the wells to be switched on at times <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t_{i}\)</span> is then simple the difference of consecutive flows. Let’s call these flow changes <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta Q\)</span>, then <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta Q_{i}=Q_{i}-Q_{i-1}\)</span> for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i&gt;0\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta Q_{0}=Q_{0}\)</span></p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
<p>Consider an aquifer of infinite lateral extend with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(kD=600\,\mathrm{m^{2}/d}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S_{y}=0.1\)</span>. If well extracts at the following flows during according to the middle picture in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-superposition-in-time-theis"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 80</span></a>.

<p>Of course, it is rather straightforward to carry out superposition with many well simultaneously, where each of them has a flow rate that varies independently of the other wells, and compute the resulting varying head or drawdown at an arbitrary location. And if we do this for many location simultaneously, we can show the the head contours in an entire region fluctuating under the influence of many wells of which each extracts at it’s own will.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">7.5.6. </span>Superposition in space<a class="headerlink" href="#superposition-in-space" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>The contributions of an arbitrary number of pumping wells can be added together, because the underlying partial differential equation is linear. Therefore, superposition works in space as well as in time. One can have an arbitrary number of wells that are pumping arbitrary amounts of water, and compute the drawdown at any number of arbitrary points simultaneously by superposition of the ensemble of wells, while per well the superposition in time is done as explained in the previous section. Because superposition is valid, the drawdown can be superimposed on the ambient groundwater head to get the real head in the aquifer.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: Consider an area with are four wells. Each well each is constructed and starts exactly one year after the previous well. The four wells are placed on a square area with sides of 1 km. The order in which they are constructed is NW, NE, SE SW. The extraction is 600 m<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^{3}\)</span>/d at from each well. The transmissivity is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(kD=600\)</span> m<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^{2}\)</span>/d and the specific yield is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S_{y}=0.24\)</span>. Visualize the drawdown in the center of the area between these wells as a function of time for a period of 10 years. Show spatial snapshots of the drawdown at times <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t=[0.5,1.5,2.5,3.5,4.5]\)</span> years after the start of the first extraction well.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#fig-example-4well-theis"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 83</span></a> shows the result of superposition in time for the point in the center of the square with the four wells at the corners. This is the same as in the previous example. Both the total result and the effect of each individual well are shown. It is practical in this case, to work in years and convert the transmissivity and the extraction to years instead of days.</p>
<p>For the spatial snapshot we compute the drawdowns in a dense-enough spacial grid to allow contouring of the drawdown at a specific point in time. The grid used is 10 m spacing between -1000 and +1000 m for both the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> and the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y\)</span> axis. With these coordinates, the distance is computed to each of the wells. The distance from the grid points to one well is already 160000 points (this requires Python, Excel can’t hardy handle this). To prevent division by zero make sure the the minimum distance is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_{w}\)</span>, the well radius. Zero distance occurs of a grid point happens to coincided with the position of a well.</p>
<p>Finally, for each of the four required snapshot times, add the contribution of each of the four wells and for each well use the time since the extraction from that well started. The last step is to contour the results as presented in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-example-4well-theis"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 83</span></a>. The figure uses the same contour lines in all four snapshots, but the values are not indicated in the figure . This, could, however, been done by using full colors and placing a color bar next to each figure . Each snapshot is taken 0.5 years after the previous well started.</p>

<p>More often than not, well screens only partially penetrate the exploited aquifer because aquifers may be much thicker than the screen length that is needed to produce the required amount of water. Limiting well depth saves money for the owner, although at the cost of some extra pumping energy, because of the extra head loss due to the fact that the streamlines of the water flowing towards the well have to concentrate near the screen, which causes it to accelerate, and higher velocities entail greater losses of energy.</p>

<p>The flow due to only the fact that the screen is partially penetrating can be superimposed on the ideal situation in which the streamlines are all horizontal and parallel with respect to top and bottom of the aquifer when towards a fully penetrating screen, for which the standard groundwater-well formulas were all derived. There are at least two ways to deal with it; both lead to an extra drawdown that must be added to the drawdown obtained with the standard formula.</p>
<p>The first method is to compute the effect of partial penetration based on the exact solution for the effect, which was derived for a confined aquifer by Hantush (see Kruseman and Ridder (1994)). The other is a method developed by Huisman (1972), which summarizes the first method by a simple relation for the extra head loss in the well itself. He writes (p130):“With a random position of the well screen as shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-partial-penetrating-screens"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 86</span></a> (left), the additional drawdown at the well face is given by</p>

<p>The method of Huisman (1972) is a summary for the effect of partial penetration in the well only. To also obtain the impact of partial penetration for points outside the well, we need a more general analytical solution. The extra drawdown due to partial penetration can be computed from the analytical solution for the extra drawdown due to partial penetration given by Hantush. It reads ((Kruseman and Ridder 1994))</p>

<p>This equation allows to compute the extra drawdown due to partial penetration at any point in the aquifer as specified by the coordinates <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z\)</span>. Hence, to estimate this extra drawdown for the well itself, one should choose some points at distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_{0}\)</span>, the well radius, and average over them, because, contrary to a real well screen that has a constant head inside, the derivation of the influence of partial penetration was under the assumption of a constant discharge per unit screen length. The latter causes some variation of head along the screen, while a uniform head causes some variation of the inflow along the screen. But the errors are not great.</p>

<p>The extra drawdown due to partial penetration given by <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-eq-partial-penetration-analytical">Eq.27</a> is a a steady-state solution, which cannot account for dynamics. However, the effect of water released from storage close to the well due to the partial penetration alone is essentially elastic. The fully penetration solution takes care of the slow storage release in case of a water table aquifer with a large storage coefficient, i.e. a specific yield <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S_{t}\)</span>. Therefore the effect of partial penetration along becomes steady-state already after a very short time. One could estimate this time as the time it takes for gradients become stable within the reach in the aquifer where of the partial-penetration effect matters. To determine that time, we can use the derived relation for the flow <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{r}\)</span> in <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-eq-q-as-function-of-r-1">Eq.25</a>. Considering that any concentration of stream lines is over beyond about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r&gt;1.5D\)</span>, we may state that the condition for this distance is (for instance)</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[Q_{R}&gt;0.9Q_{0}\]</div>
<p>and so, with <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-eq-q-as-function-of-r-1">Eq.25</a> we get</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
0.9 &amp; = &amp; e^{-u}\\
\ln0.9 &amp; = &amp; -u\\
-0.10536 &amp; = &amp; -u\end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>so that</p>

t &amp; &gt; &amp; 10\frac{r^{2}S}{4kD}\end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>To illustrate this, let <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r=2D,\)</span> a conservative estimate, so that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t&gt;10SD/k\)</span>.

<p>Although the range of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span> where effects of partial penetration can play is generally said to be <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\le1.5D\)</span>, we may need a larger distance when the aquifer is vertically anisotropic as given by different values of the horizontal and vertical conductivity, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k_{r}\)</span>and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k_{z}\)</span> respectively.

<span id="id18"></span><h3><span class="section-number">7.6.3. </span>Example<a class="headerlink" href="#example-3" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>After having implemented <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-eq-partial-penetration-analytical">Eq.27</a> in Python, we can compute the effect of partial penetration for any point in the aquifer and add it to the drawdown for the fully penetrating well. This was done. <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-head-contours-pp-screen"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 87</span></a> shows the head contours due to a partially penetrating screen between <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(30\le z\le40\)</span> m placed in an aquifer where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0\le z\le50\)</span> m. The actual situation, shown in the bottom picture, is the superposition of the heads due to a fully penetrating well, shown in the top picture, and the effect of partial penetration, shown in the middle picture. The streamlines (not plotted) are perpendicular to the head contours and show the contraction of the flow near the screen, especially near the ends of the screen. The bottom picture in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-head-contours-pp-screen"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 87</span></a> was obtained by adding <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-eq-partial-penetration-analytical">Eq.27</a> to a simple Dupuit solution <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s=Q/\left(2\pi kD\right)\ln\left(R/r\right)\)</span>, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R=100\)</span> was chosen. The contribution of the head due to partial penetration has a positive zone in front of the screen, where the drawdown is increased and negative zones above and below the screen, where the drawdown is reduced by partial penetration, but where the flow is much smaller than directly opposite the screen. As can be seen from the pictures, the effect of the partial penetration does not reach farther than about one aquifer thickness from the well (in this vertically isotropic aquifer). So the 1.5D mentioned above for the practical reach of the impact of partial penetration is good for most practical situations, unless the aquifer is very anisotropic in the vertical sense.</p>
<p>In conclusion, for such a detailed picture and computation of the head around a well screen we don’t need a large 3D numerical model at all. And, if you have such a model, you can use the analytical approach to verify that you haven’t made mistakes in this big model.</p>

<p>Pumping-tests drawdowns do not always resemble the Theis or Hantush type curves; sometimes the drawdown shows a double dip, which is known as delayed yield. Because delayed yield is quite ubiquitous, it has been studied extensively by scholars in the past, most noticeably by Boulton (1963), Pricket (1971) and Neuman (1974, 1975). While Boulton (1963, 1973) introduced an extra delay parameter to explain the phenomenon, Pricket (1971) demonstrated for a large number of pumping tests in his home state in the USA that the Boulton solution well matched the curves obtained from real-world tests. However, there was no direct physical mechanism behind Boulton’s delay parameter. It remains, therefore, unclear what its precise origin was. It was often assumed that it had to be the unsaturated zone, which is not accounted for in the known groundwater flow solutions. And, indeed, early groundwater-flow models, that accounted for saturated and unsaturated flow simultaneously were able to match the curves that had been measured by Pricket (1971) (see also Cooley and Case (1973)). However, it was Neuman (1974), who solved the problem by showing that the delayed yield could be completely described by the combination of elastic storage, which operates throughout the aquifer, and and storage from the decline of the water table, which is generally accounted for by specific yield. Neuman (1974, 1975) derived an analytical solution for the flow to a well in a water-table aquifer, while taking into account vertical flow components. He showed that the released water initially stems from elastic storage, due to the expansion of the water and the compaction of the soil skeleton, which is a fast process due to the low value of this storage. He further showed that very soon after the start of the pump, the water table starts declining, which releases much more water by emptying pores near the water table, which, therefore is a slow process. It means that after some time, the release of pore water at the water table becomes the dominant process. The result in drawdown line is a graph that resembles two Theis curves, an early Theis curve in accordance with the elastic storage, and a late Theis curve, in accordance with specific-yield storage.</p>

<p>We may show the phenomena on the hand of some numerical simulations as shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-delayed-yield-three-graphs"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 88</span></a>. The first picture shows the drawdown versus time for a number of points at different distances from the well and for different depths as expressed in % of the aquifer thickness. The colors correspond to three depths. The blue curves are near the top of the aquifer, the magenta curves in the center of the aquifer, and the green curves near the bottom. As the figure indicates, the drawdowon differs with depth, but only for piezometers that are not far from the well; at later times this difference disappears. The second picture in the same figure shows the depth-averaged drawdown for a number of distances from the well. The later curves correspond to larger differences. One sees that the curves initially correspond to the Theis drawdown computed for the elastic storage coefficient, while later on they match the drawdown that corresponds to the Theis solution for the specific yield. The shorter the distance to the well, the more pronounced the transition between the two Theis curves is. Obviously, the curves that correspond to the larger distances are later. The effect of depth has been eliminated from the second chart by taking the average head over the full depth of the aquifer at each distance. The third picture in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-delayed-yield-three-graphs"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 88</span></a> demonstrates the difference of the drawdown at different depths at the same location, which was chosen at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r=28.4\)</span> m from the well. From these graphs, it becomes especially manifest that the closer to the water table, the later the drawdown graph.</p>

<p>These graphs in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-delayed-yield-three-graphs"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 88</span></a> were computed using a numerical axially-symmetric model with elastic storage everywhere, but only specific yield at the water table. There is no unsaturated zone in the model. This is in accordance with Neuman (1972) who explained that the phenomenon of delayed yield can be fully explained by the simultaneous action of the elastic storage in the whole aquifer and the specific yield at the water table.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">7.7.3. </span>Generalization to semi-confined aquifers<a class="headerlink" href="#generalization-to-semi-confined-aquifers" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>We may now generalize delayed yield, by extending it to any groundwater system in which a water table will decline in a reaction to pumping. This especially holds true for semi-confined aquifers. The Hanush assumptions underlying his solution include a fixed head in the overlying layer. When in reality this head cannot be maintained, it will cause a delayed-yield effect. This may be the case in many practical situations without it being determined in a pumping test, because the pumping has stopped long before the delayed yield would become visual in the drawdown curves. The reason is the delay that is caused by the resistance against vertical flow from the overlying layer. That this is the case, is explained by the characteristic time for filling the semi-confined aquifer given an initial head difference with the overlying layer. This characteristic time, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T\)</span>, equals <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T=Sc\)</span> where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span> is the elastic storage coefficient of the aquifer and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c\)</span> the resistance of the overlying layer against vertical flow. With typical values of say <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S=0.001\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c=500\)</span> d, we have <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T=0.5\)</span> d. This means that a sudden lowering of the head in the semi-confined aquifer would be fully compensated by increased leakage in about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(5T\approx2.5\)</span> d. This characteristic time affects only the level of the transition zone between the two Theis curves. We can show this by computing the drawdown in a semi-confined aquifer. For this we use an aquifer system consisting of a resistance cover layer that is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(D_{cover}=12\)</span> m thick on top of a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(D_{aquif}=35\)</span> m thick aquifer. The well is fully penetrating. Four models are compared that differ only in the vertical resistance of the cover layer, with values is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c=[10,100,1000,10000]\)</span> days respectively. Specific yield is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S_{y}=0.2\)</span>, the elastic storage coefficient of the aquifer is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S=0.002\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S_{s}=S/D_{aquif}\)</span>; the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k_{h}=10m/d\)</span>, hence the transmissivity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(kD=350\,\mathrm{m^{2}/d}\)</span>. The results are presented <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-z-averaged-drawdown-4-layers"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 89</span></a>.</p>
<p>This figure shows the drawdown averaged over the thickness of the aquifer for different distances from the well. We expect the first branch of the graphs to resemble Hanush’s semi-confined drawdown, for which the value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r/\lambda\)</span> determines the elevation of their horizontal equilibrium branch. The spreading lengths of the four models are <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda=[59,\,187,\,,591,\,1870]\)</span> m respectively. The lower the value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r/\lambda\)</span>, the more the Hantush curve deviates from the Theis curve. This effect is clearly visible when the first picture is compared with the fourth. When the vertical resistance is high, the transfer to the late Theis curve is much delayed. One sees this in the fourth picture, where the graphs don’t even reach the second Theis branch at the end of the simulation time, which was as large as 600 days! When the resistance is low, as in the first figure , the graphs do show a clear transfer from the elastic Theis curve to the water-table Theis curve (first picture). The picture also shows that the drawdown for points near the well resemble the elastic Theis curve, while the points at large distances do not reveal any elastic behavior; they immediately follow the specific-yield Theis curve. The reason is that the first branch should follow Hantush which has an equilibrium <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q/\left(2\pi kD\right)\mbox{K}_{0}\left(r/\lambda\right)\)</span>, which approaches zero for large <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span>. Hence, points at larger <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span>, say at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r&gt;3\lambda\)</span> will never see the elastic drawdown due to the leakage. The second branch, however, is a pure Theis curve, which has no equilibrium, because it has no recharge (all its water comes from water-table storage). Therefore, points far away from the well will eventually all feel the phreatic drawdown as predicted by Theis (if there are no head boundaries might prevent this).</p>
<p>To determine the resistance of the overlying layer, one should use the piezometers that reach a Hantush-equilibrium and use the Hantush solution to interpret them. This also yields the elastic storage coefficient. If the test is sufficiently long, so that one or more piezometers reach the phreatich Theis branch, then also the specific yield of the overlying layer can be determined by applying the Theis solution to the second branch. As was said earlier, the resistance of the overlying layer does not determine the position of the two bounding Theis curves; it only determines the height of the horizontal branch of the curves where they transfer from the elastic to the specify yield Theis curve.</p>

First of all, one sees that the head difference between the top and the bottom of the aquifer can be neglected; only the model with the low resistance shows a small difference. This is because in that case the the vertical velocities in the aquifer are large enough to cause a small head loss between the top and the bottom of the aquifer (notice that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k_{z}=k_{r}=10\,\mathrm{m/d}\)</span> was used). Again, one observes that the horizontal branch climbs with reduced <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r/\lambda\)</span> between the four models. The blue line is the drawdown in the top of the overlying layer, i.e. that of the water table itself. This blue line thus reveals the emptying of the top layer due to the downward leakage invoked by the drawdown in the pumped aquifer below.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">7.7.4. </span>The two Theis bounding curves<a class="headerlink" href="#the-two-theis-bounding-curves" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>It was explained before that position of the two bounding Theis curves only depend on their respective storage coefficients and not on the resistance of the covering layer. Notice that we have for the two Theis curves</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\frac{1}{u_{1}}=\frac{4kD}{S}\frac{t}{r^{2}}\mbox{ and }\,\frac{1}{u_{2}}=\frac{4kD}{S_{y}}\frac{t}{r^{2}}\]</div>
<p>Hence, the horizontal axes of both Theis curves only differ in their storage coefficient. And so</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\frac{u_{2}}{u_{1}}=\frac{S_{y}}{S}\]</div>
<p>Hence the horizontal axis of the specific-yield Theis curve is the one of the elastic-storage Theis curve multiplied by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S_{y}/S\)</span>. On the logarithmic scale this is a horizontal shift. Because we have chosen values <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S_{y}/S\)</span>=100, the second Theis curve is shifted over exactly two log-cycles to the right of the first, elastic-storage Theis curve, which can be verified immediately in the graphs.</p>
<p>This also implies the following for the determination of the specific yield from a pumping test that shows a clear delayed-yield behavior. Simply determine the horizontal shift of the second with respect to the first Theis curve, which is factor <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau\)</span>, and then apply <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S_{y}=\tau S\)</span>.</p>

The figure is essentially equal to the previous picture but the graphs are now drawn for several distances. Once again, the time-drawdown curves for points inside the aquifer stay between the two bounding Theis curves. The curve for the water table lags behind and only joins the specific-yield Theis curve late. This join point falls later the higher the vertical resistance of the overlying layer and the distance from the will. The lower the resistance of the overlying layer, the more will this semi-confined aquifer system resemble the purely phreatic aquifer system that we discussed in the beginning of this chapter.</p>

<p>It should be clear that partial penetration causes the drawdown near the well screen to become larger than the Theis drawdown predicts. Hence, one should first correct piezometers closer than about 1D from the well for partial penetration (see section on partial penetration) before analyzing any pumping test. This is illustrated in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-effect-of-partial-on-delayed-yield"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 92</span></a>. It shows the drawdown in the top (cyan) and bottom (magenta) of the aquifer for a nearby point ( <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r=9\)</span> m, thick lines) and a distant point ( <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r=90\)</span> m, thin lines). The figure s show that at a point at a large distance from the well is not influenced by partial penetration, as the darwdown in the top and bottom of the aquifer are practically the same and the curves stay between the Theis envelopes, which are the same as in the cases with fully penetrating screens. However, a point close to the well, i.e. less than about 1 to 1.5 aquifer thicknesses away, may experience a serious deviation caused by partial penetration. The point opposite the well screen at the top of the aquifer (thick cyan line) has a drawdown that is larger than that for a fully penetrating screen; the point at the same distance but at the bottom of the aquifer (far below the screen, thick magenta line) has a much lower drawdown than would be the case with a fully penetrating screen. Moreover, these differences do not disappear with time. On the other hand, if we correct for partial penetration by subtracting the effect from all measurements, we regain the fully penetrating drawdowns, which are then directly amenable to interpretation using the standard solutions of Theis and Hantush.</p>

<p>The solution of Theis for transient flow in an unbounded confined or unconfined aquifer is based on the assumption that the storage inside the well casing can be neglected. While this is generally a valid assumption for tube wells, and, therefore, for wells in semi-confined and confined aquifers, it may not hold in unconfined aquifers when large-diameter dug wells are used, such as the one shown in figure 44, which is a picture of a large open well in India. Especially when the transmissivity of the aquifer is low, the storage in a large diameter well represents a large portion of the water extracted, at least on the short run, and will thus have a substantial influence on the drawdown. This influence must be taken into account when interpreting drawdown tests on such wells. It should be clear that the formula for a large-diameter well will also hold true when pumping water from a pond.</p>
<p>Papadopoulos and Cooper (1967) (see Kruseman and Ridder (1994), p175) derived an analytical solution for the drawdown in a fully penetrating large-diameter well, taking into account the storage in the casing of the well. The partial differential equation upon which it is based is the same as the one used by Theis. However, the boundary condition at the well face differs; the extraction must now match both the inflow from the aquifer and the drawdown inside the well casing. It thus becomes</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">8.1. </span>What convolution is and how it works<a class="headerlink" href="#what-convolution-is-and-how-it-works" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>Convolution is applied in many branches of science. Because it is so widely and flexibly applicable, it is important to have a thorough understanding of it.</p>
<p>Convolution is a general principle that can be seen as smart superposition, which allows for efficient simulation of linear systems with arbitrary time (or space) varying inputs. In dealing with groundwater it allows interpreting pumping tests with arbitrarily varying extractions (Olsthoorn 2008). It further allows simulation of the groundwater head due to arbitrarily varying river stages as well has groundwater head fluctuations as a function of varying recharge. It is also heavily used in time-series analysis. In mathematical course books, convolution is mostly explained in connection with the Laplace transform, which has some advantages in dealing with it mathematically. However, it is not necessary to understand or apply it. So we do not need this here. In the end convolution boils down to a moving weighted average of the past input data, in which the weight are the response to a unit pulse.</p>
<p>The essential condition for convolution to work is that the response of the system in question due to some physical pulse is unique and proportional to the magnitude of that pulse. A short rain shower is an example of such a pulse due to which the groundwater level will respond by first rising and subsequently declining until the effect of the shower has completely disappeared. The reaction of the system in question to a pulse of unit magnitude is called the impulse response <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mbox{IR}\left(\tau\right)\)</span>. The impulse response depends only on <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau\)</span>, i.e. the time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t_{0}\)</span> since the pulse took place, hence <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau=t-t_{0}\)</span> (see <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-impulse-response"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 96</span></a>). Notice that the dimension of the pulse (in this case 1 mm of rain for instance) may be completely different from the dimension of the reaction of the system (change of head or change of flow for instance).</p>
<p>We can subdivide any arbitrary time-input into a series of subsequent pulses, for instance, daily rain figure s can be seen as such a continuous input as well as a series of rain pulses. But also a time-varying pumping rate or river stage, can be regarded as a series of hourly or daily pulses. If one imagines an infinite series of unit pulses glued together, say after <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t=t_{0}\)</span>, then for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t&gt;t_{0}\)</span> we have a continuous unit input (a unit input that is an input with the value equal to 1, like 1 mm/d continuous rain). The response of the system to such a continuous unit input after <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t=t_{0}\)</span> is called the step response, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mbox{SR}\left(\tau\right)\)</span>. In our example this could mean that the well starts pumping at a rate <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q=1\)</span> at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t=t_{0}\)</span> and it keeps pumping with this rate forever.</p>
<p>Notice that most analytic solutions of groundwater flow are, in fact, step responses. For instance, the solution for the change of groundwater head or discharge due to a sudden change of the water level of the river, i.e. the expression <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\left(x,t\right)=A\,\mathtt{erfc}\left(u\right)\mbox{, with }u=\sqrt{x^{2}S/\left(4kDt\right)}\)</span> is such an example. The same is true for the Theis and the Hantush solutions, they too assume a sudden change from zero to a fixed extraction at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t=0\)</span>, which remains forever constant thereafter.</p>
<p>Because the step response can be regarded as the response due to an infinite number of unit pulses for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t&gt;t_{0}\)</span>, it immediately follows that</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
\mbox{SR}\left(\tau\right) &amp; = &amp; \intop_{t=0}^{t}\mbox{IR}\left(\nu\right)d\nu\\
\mbox{IR} &amp; = &amp; \frac{\partial\,\mathrm{SR}\left(\tau\right)}{\partial\tau}\end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>In practice, we deal with pulses that have a given duration, such as the rainfall during one day. Of course, the rain will vary during the day, but in the end we may not possess data on a shorter time scale than one day, and, therefore, the daily rainfall may be the best and most detailed data that we than obtain in a given case. We will then probably treat these figure s as the average rainfall for each day as the best approximation of the time-varying precipitation. Of course, if one has hourly data, one may use these data as average values for each hour as the best approximation.</p>
<p>So in general, we will have a series of figure s for daily (or hourly, weekly or monthly) precipitation, evapotranspiration, river stage, extraction rate etc.</p>
<p>We then need the so-called block response <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mbox{BR}\left(\tau,\Delta\tau\right)\)</span>. The bock response is the result of a sudden change of an input variable, for instance rain, with a unit magnitude, that is constant during a given time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta\tau\)</span> and zero thereafter. It’s the result of a unit pulse of fixed duration. The easiest way to compute the block response is by superposition</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\mbox{BR}\left(\tau,\Delta\tau\right)=\mbox{SR}\left(\tau\right)-\mbox{SR}\left(\tau-\Delta\tau\right)\]</div>
<p>Which is what we have been doing by our superposition. For instance, with a well in an groundwater system of infinite extent, that fulfills the presumptions underlying the Theis solution, we may write</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-eq-block-response">
<span class="eqno">(28)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-eq-block-response" title="Permalink to this equation"></a></span>\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
\mbox{BR}\left(\tau,\Delta\tau\right) &amp; = &amp; 0\mbox{, for }\tau\le0\\
\mbox{BR}\left(\tau,\Delta\tau\right) &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{4\pi kD}\mbox{W}\left(\frac{r^{2}S}{4kD\tau}\right)\mbox{, for }0&lt;\tau\le\Delta\tau\ \\
\mbox{BR}\left(\tau,\Delta\tau\right) &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{4\pi kD}\left[\mbox{W}\left(\frac{r^{2}S}{4kD\tau}\right)-\mbox{W}\left(\frac{r^{2}S}{4kD\left(\tau-\Delta\tau\right)}\right)\right]\mbox{, for }\tau&gt;\Delta\tau\end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Based on the previous superposition we can readily compute the required response of the system using the standard groundwater solutions.</p>

<p>Convolution as a smart way of doing this superposition; it takes a different perspective, one that is illustrated in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-turning-the-impulse-around"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 98</span></a>: the essence is that it turns the system response around. Let’s see how that works.</p>
<p>Consider a fixed point in time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span>, which is a time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau\)</span> after the pulse. The top image shows this pulse, its reaction, the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mbox{IR}(\tau)\)</span> or the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mbox{BR}\left(\tau,\Delta\tau\right)\)</span>. It also shows the considered time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span>, which is indicated by the vertical line connecting the two graphs. The impact of the pulse at time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t-\tau\)</span> on the system at time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> is the pulse or block response for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau\)</span> multiplied by the actual height of the pulse, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span>. Hence the result <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\)</span> of the pulse is</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-eq-result-of-a-ipulse-at-time-t-tau">
<span class="eqno">(29)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-eq-result-of-a-ipulse-at-time-t-tau" title="Permalink to this equation"></a></span>\[s=p\left(t-\tau\right)\mbox{IR}\left(\tau\right)\]</div>
<p>as indicated in the top figure . Read this formula as the“result of the pulse at t equals the impulse response <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mbox{IR}\left(\tau\right)\)</span> multiplied by the magnitude of the pulse at time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t-\tau\)</span>, i.e. at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau\)</span> days ago.”</p>
<p>But this is identical with what we get in the bottom figure , where the impulse response is taken relative to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> itself and is reversed in time. Taking this perspective, we would say:“the effect of a pulse at time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t-\tau\)</span> (or“a time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau\)</span> ago”) equals the reversed impulse response at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mbox{IR}\left(\tau\right)\)</span> times the height of the pulse at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t-\tau\)</span>.” This is exactly the same as <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-eq-result-of-a-ipulse-at-time-t-tau">Eq.29</a>. This perspective is illustrated in the bottom picture of <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-turning-the-impulse-around"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 98</span></a>.</p>

</div>
<p>But this is true the effect at time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> now of any pulse in the past. There is no need to shift the reversed curve at all. So with this perspective, the only thing we have to do to compute the result at time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> due to all inputs of the past, i.e. for time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-\infty&lt;time&lt;t\)</span>, is to multiply each pulse happening a time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau\)</span> ago, that is at time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t-\tau\)</span> by the value of the impulse response at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau\)</span>. This is illustrated in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-convolution-is-the-multiplication-of"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 99</span></a>, and the result if given in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-result-of-the-convolution"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 100</span></a>. If we compare this procedure with the basic superposition shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-the-effect-of-a-series-of-pulses"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 97</span></a>, we see that, to compute the state of the system at any given point of time due to what happened in the past, requires only one reversed impulse response, which has to be multiplied with the corresponding the past input (such as rain, river stage or flow rate).</p>
<p>Mathematically this can be generalized as follows</p>

<p>where the input <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span> is continuous. In the case we split up the past in discrete steps of length <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta\tau\)</span> for which we the average intensity (daily values, say), we use the block response for the corresponding step length <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta\tau\)</span>. Then we have</p>

<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_{t-\tau_{i}-\Delta\tau\rightarrow t-\tau_{i}}\)</span> means the intensity of the input between <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t-\tau_{i}-\Delta\tau\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t-\tau_{i}\)</span> with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mbox{BR}\left(\tau,\Delta\tau\right)\)</span> as defined in <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-eq-block-response">Eq.28</a>.

<p>Final note: Mathematicians mostly take the integral in <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-eq-convolution-continuous">Eq.30</a> over <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-\infty&lt;\tau&lt;\infty\)</span>, which is equivalent to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\infty&lt;\tau&lt;0\)</span>, because the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mbox{IR}\left(\tau\right)\)</span> is zero for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t&lt;0\)</span> for physical reasons: a response can only exist after it has happened.</p>

<p>We can readily carry out a convolution in a spreadsheet or in Python. Python is more straightforward and flexible, therefore we’ll use Python. To do convolution, we need input data, like a time series of the river water level and the impulse response (instantaneous pulse of zero-length but with given magnitude equal to 1) or block response block response (a pulse of of intensity 1 during a fixed time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta\tau\)</span>), i.e. the river level rises suddenly by 1 m and and falls again by 1 m after time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta\tau\)</span>, which will be the length of our time step. Working with the block response is easiest to comprehend, so we’ll use that. When we have both the input and the block response, we have to carry out the convolution. The convolution for one time <em>t</em> is the past input up to time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span>, weighted by the block response reversed in time, that is we multiply the input at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t-\tau\)</span> with the block-response value for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau\)</span>. Both the past input and the block response are entire arrays. So, the input array up to time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> is multiplied by the block-response array reversed in time to get the effect of all past input at time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span>. This is for one point in time, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span>. To get the result of the convolution for all times, we have to repeat this procedure for all times. What you notice, is, that convolution is in essence a moving weighted average of the input. The input is weighted by the reversed block response and for each time.</p>
<p>In mathematics, convolution is a standard procedure. Many engineering problems are solved through it. Single processing engineers use it all the time to analyze signals. Also in hydrology, convolution is used to analyze time hydrological time series. Therefore, in practice we can make use of standard procedures and functions to carry out the work. In Python, the convolution can be carried out by the function <em>scipy.signal.lfilter</em>, or by the function <em>scipy.signal.convolve</em>.</p>
<p>The first example is to compute the groundwater head resulting from an arbitrary fluctuation of the surface-water level over time of due to an arbitrary varying extraction from a well. The block response is</p>

<p>Let’s use the following figure : <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(kD=600\)</span> m<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(^{2}\)</span>/d, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S=0.1\)</span> and we use river level data of the river Meuse at Eijsden on the border between Belgium and The Netherlands. The data can be downloaded from the Internet for a 28 most recent period (Search for “Rijkswaterstaat peil” and find your way). Measurements are taken every 10 minutes. Hence, we use <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta\tau\)</span> is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10\)</span> min as well. The data for 28 days thus hold 4030 measurements of the river Meuse stage. Reading the <em>.csv</em> file into Python is straightforward using Pandas McKinney (2017). Pandas is the worldwide most-used Python package to handle data tables, a must-know when working with lots of data and tables.</p>
<p>The next listing loads the <em>Pandas</em> module module and <em>dateutil.parser.parse</em> function to parse dates and times.

Finally, we drop the date and time columns we no longer need. The resulting DataFrame than has only one column “Meting” with the measurements, in cm, which we convert to m.</p>

<p>The next 2 lines compute <strong>dtau</strong> and <strong>tau</strong>. These lines do that directly from the index, which contains only timestamps (<strong>datetime</strong> objects). The first line subtracts the second <strong>datetime</strong> from the first <strong>datetime</strong> to get the difference as a <strong>timedelta</strong> object. This is tau already, however to convert it into days as a floating point number, it has to be divided by the <strong>datetime</strong> object for one day. This generates the value 0.00694. Which is 10 minutes as a day, i.e. 10/(24 * 60). This seems overdone, but the point is, that this method will work for any data set irrespective of the interval length it happens to use.</p>
<p>Subtracting the first <strong>datetime</strong> from the entire index yields a list of <strong>timedelta</strong> objects. Dividing this by the <strong>timedelta</strong> of one day, yields <strong>tau</strong> in days as a floating point array, with one value every 10 minutes, expressed in days.</p>

<p>Because we have no infinite past, we start with the mean value of the data that we have a an estimate of the most likely value to start with. Then we apply the linear filter, function <em>lfilter(…)</em> (from the Python module <em>scipy.signal</em>) on the measurements minus the average. We could do without using the average value, but than it takes a run-in period to get rid of the start-value, which is zero by default. The length of the run-in period is equal to the length of the block response. In the current situation, this response is reasonable short, but in other situations that might not be the case, for instance with Theis wells that will never reach equilibrium. We’ll handle a Theis case hereafter.</p>

<p>Let us now illustrate the difference between impulse response and block response, also for the river stage.</p>
<p>The block response of the river stage is given in <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-eq-block-response-river-stage">Eq.32</a>, while the step response is the known solution itself:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\mbox{SR}\left(\tau\right)=\mathrm{erfc}\left(\sqrt{\frac{x^{2}S}{4kD\tau}}\right)\]</div>
<p>The impulse response is obtained by differentiation of the step response with respect to time.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-eq-analytical-impuse-response">
<span class="eqno">(33)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-eq-analytical-impuse-response" title="Permalink to this equation"></a></span>\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
\mbox{IR}\left(\tau\right) &amp; = &amp; \frac{\partial}{\partial\tau}\left\{ \mathrm{erfc}\left(\sqrt{\frac{x^{2}S}{4kD\tau}}\right)\right\} \\
 &amp; = &amp; \frac{\partial}{\partial\tau}\left(\intop_{u}^{\infty}\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}e^{-\nu^{2}}d\nu\right)\mbox{, with }u=\sqrt{\frac{x^{2}S}{4kD\tau}}\\
 &amp; = &amp; -\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}e^{-u^{2}}\frac{\partial u}{\partial\tau}\\
 &amp; = &amp; -\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}e^{-u^{2}}\left(-\frac{1}{2\tau\sqrt{\tau}}\sqrt{\frac{x^{2}S}{4kD}}\right)\\
 &amp; = &amp; \frac{\sqrt{\frac{x^{2}S}{4kD\tau}}}{\tau\sqrt{\pi}}e^{-u^{2}}\\
 &amp; = &amp; \frac{u}{\tau\sqrt{\pi}}e^{-u^{2}}\nonumber \end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Note that time is embedded in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u\)</span>. For small step widths <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta\tau\)</span>, the values of the block response almost equal those of the impulse response when multiplied by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta\tau\)</span>,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\mbox{BR}\left(\tau,\Delta\tau\right)\approx\mbox{IR}\left(\tau\right)\Delta\tau\]</div>
<p>This should be obvious because the content of the block response is its intensity, which is equal to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1\)</span> spread over the duration of the block, which is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta\tau\)</span>, while the impulse response is a pulse of zero duration but of total contents equal to 1. Hence, the numerical value of the block response is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta\tau\)</span>, which is also the value of the impulse response multiplied by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta\tau\)</span>. This is also obvious mathematically,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\mbox{BR}\left(\tau,\Delta\tau\right)=\mbox{erfc}(\dots,\tau)-\mbox{erfc}(\dots,\tau-\Delta\tau)\approx\frac{\partial\mbox{erfc}\left(\dots,\tau\right)}{\partial\tau}\times\Delta\tau\]</div>
<p>For values of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau\gg\Delta\tau\)</span> the difference disappears. This is illustrated in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-block-response-and-analutical-impulsre-response-graph"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 103</span></a>. The two responses are virtually identical except for smaller <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau\)</span> and especially for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau&lt;\Delta\tau\)</span>, but this does not affect practical use of either. In practice, I prefer to always use the block response as it is exact and always obtainable from the given step response by a simple subtraction.</p>

<p>For this example the signal can just as well be generated. For this first get a time array. In this case we take days starting in the past, 350 days ago or 350 days before a given date. Then generate an array of random values between 0 and 1. The length of the array is the same as that of the array of times. Subtract 0.5 to get values between -0.5 and 0.5. Filter using a moving average of length 25, to smooth the data somewhat. Finally multiply by Q0 to get a time-varying extraction that covers the entire simulation period.</p>

<p>The results are shown in the third image of <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-theis-with-convolution"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 104</span></a>. To illustrate its correctness, also the theis drawdown was plotted for the average extraction, i.e. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_{0}\)</span>.</p>
<p>A similar plot can be made by plotting the drawdown on logarithmic time axis. However, for that we need to prevent negative times on the time axis, and so we must use the time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t-t_{0}\)</span>, with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t_{0}\)</span> the time that the well started, which is assumed at the first value of the time series.</p>

<p>The solution for drainage after a sudden uniform recharge on a strip of land between two canals with maintained water level was given in chapter <a class="reference external" href="#sec:Symmetrical-drainage-from-charcteristic-time">[sec:Symmetrical-drainage-from-charcteristic-time]</a> <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-eq-kraaijenoff-van-der-leur-verruijt">Eq.19</a> .

When regarding the sudden rise <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> as due to a (recharge) shower <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span>, then <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A=\frac{p}{S}\)</span> and we can write that formula, taking <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p=1\)</span> as</p>

This time increase from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T=13\)</span> d for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2b=400\)</span> m in the top image to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T=1300\)</span> d for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2b=4000\)</span> m in the third picture. The factor <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(100\)</span> is due to the fact that the characteristic time is proportional to the square of the basin width. The block responses for the three basins that differ only in width are given in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-block-responses-basins"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 112</span></a>. The large the memory of the groundwater system, the longer the past period over which the recharge is integrated and has an effect on on the head. Because the average recharge in this example (Dutch data) is positive, a large system must show heads that are always above its boundaries (zero). This is indeed the case in the third picture, and more so for points farther away from the boundaries, i.e. more to the center line of the basin. The shorter the system memory, the more often a dry period can cause the heads to fall below the water levels of bounding canals or rivers. Also, the shorter the memory the lower will the average head be relative to the bounding surface water level. This simulation is realistic, except for the fact that it was assumed that the water from a recharge pulse reaches the groundwater immediately. While this may be a good approximation for shallow groundwater, it is not realistic where the water table is 10 m or more below ground surface. In such situations, it may take several months before a recharge pulse causes the flow from the unsaturated zone into the saturated zone to increase. A thick unsaturated zone causes the recharge arrival in the saturated zone to be delayed and somewhat smoothed. If this delay and smoothing can be estimated from an unsaturated zone analyses of from measurements, it may be included by filtering the recharge time series before using it has input for the head simulation. Filtering is just a moving averaging procedure, hence a convolution, which can be carried out with the same function <em>lfilter(…)</em>, all we need is a block response that relates the recharge to the flux at the bottom of the unsaturated zone.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">9.1. </span>Sudden head rise at the boundary of a one-dimensional semi-infinite aquifer<a class="headerlink" href="#sudden-head-rise-at-the-boundary-of-a-one-dimensional-semi-infinite-aquifer" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>The Laplace transform is used to solve the one-dimensional partial differential equation, known as the diffusion equation. The Laplace transform removes time from the partial differential equation after which we only have to solve a steady state situation, whose solution we already know. Once we have this solution in Laplace space we convert it back to time by looking up the result in a Laplace transform table (Abramowitz and Stegun (1972)).</p>
<p>We consider a one-dimensional aquifer with constant transmissivity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(kD\)</span> with initial head zero at a bounding a river at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x=0\)</span> whose water level is suddenly increased at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t=0\)</span>.</p>
<p>The differential equation is</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\frac{kD}{S}\frac{\partial^{2}\phi}{\partial x^{2}}=\frac{\partial\phi}{\partial t}\]</div>
<p>with as boundary conditions:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
\phi\left(0,r\right) &amp; = &amp; 0\\
\phi\left(t,0\right) &amp; = &amp; h\end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Taking the Laplace transform of the differential equation and its boundary conditions yields:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
\frac{kD}{S}\frac{\partial^{2}\overline{\phi}}{\partial x^{2}}-s\overline{\phi} &amp; = &amp; 0\\
\overline{\phi}\left(s,0\right) &amp; = &amp; \frac{h}{s}\end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>The solution in Laplace space is easily found as it is the same as the stationary solution for a 1-D leaky aquifer with fixed head at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x=0\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\overline{\phi}=\frac{h}{s}e^{-x/\lambda}\]</div>
<p>The steady state solution was for the differential equation</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial^{2}\phi}{\partial x^{2}}-\frac{\phi}{\lambda^{2}} &amp; = &amp; 0\\
\phi\left(0\right) &amp; = &amp; h\end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\phi=he^{-\frac{x}{\lambda}}\]</div>
<p>From which it follows that</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{aligned}
\lambda &amp; = &amp; \sqrt{\frac{kD}{sS}}\end{aligned}\]</div>
<p>So that</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\overline{\phi}=\frac{h}{s}e^{-x\sqrt{\frac{S}{kD}}\sqrt{s}}\]</div>
<p>The inverse transform is given by Abramowitz and Stegun (1964, p1026, item 29.3.83):</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\mbox{F}\left(s\right)=\frac{1}{s}e^{-\kappa\sqrt{s}}\mbox{ }\rightarrow\mbox{ }\mathrm{f}\left(t\right)=\mbox{erfc}\left(\frac{\kappa}{2\sqrt{t}}\right)\]</div>
<p>Hence, with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\kappa\)</span> replaced by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{x^{2}S}{kD}\)</span> we find</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\phi=h\,\mathrm{erfc}\left(\sqrt{\frac{x^{2}S}{4kDt}}\right)\]</div>
<p>Which is the sought solution.</p>

<p>The Laplace transform is one method, perhaps the most practical and universal to solve partial differential equation that depend on time. The Laplace transform removes the time derivative from the partial differential equation (Bruggeman 1999), after which is can be solved as a steady-state problem. Once we have the steady-state solution in Laplace space, we have to transfer it back to time, which is done with conversion tables, see Abramowitz and Stegun (1972).Bruggeman (1999) gives a full derivation for the leaky aquifer case of Hantush. Here we apply the Laplace transform on the transient well extraction studied by Theis. You may also want to look at a paper on this, Loáciga (2009), showing various approaches.</p>
