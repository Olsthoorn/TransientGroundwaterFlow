Question 1:
-----------

A well is installed at 250 m distance from a river. The well fully penetrates the aquifer. The aquifer is unconfined, it has a conductivity of k= 30 m/d and a representative thickness of 40 m, which may be assumed constant. It further has a storage coefficient (specific yield) of S=0.20. The well extracts water at a rate of *Q*\ =1200 m\ :sup:`3`/d during exactly 7 days, after which it stops. The questions refer to the drawdown in point p at 50 m from the well on the line through the well perpendicular to the river as shown in the figure.

Note that the transmissivity may be considered constant. The river water level varies continuously according to a sinewave with a cycle time of *T= 1* d and an amplitude of *A=1.2* m.

      Aquifer bounded by fully penetrating water body with fluctuating water level at x=0. The aquifer extents at the right to infinity. Shown is the water table (or head) at an arbitrary time.

#. What is the maximum and minimum head at *x = 25* m and at *x = 100* m?

#. What is the delay of the wave at *x = 100* m relative to the wave at *x = 0* m?

#. By how much (i.e., by how large a factor) does this delay change if the storage coefficient would be 100 times as small as the given value, i.e., if it would be :math:`S=0.001` instead of :math:`S=0.1`?

The picture below shows an aquifer of limited lateral extent. To the left, at *x = 0*, it is bounded by a fully penetrating surface water body, such as a lake. To the right, at *x = L*, it is bounded by an impervious land mass as shown. The aquifer properties are shown in the picture, but you don’t need them to answer the questions. The water level of the lake and the groundwater table are initially flat at a level equal to *h=0* m as indicated by the horizontal blue line. At :math:`t\ =\ 0`, the water level of the lake suddenly changes upward by an amount *A* as indicated. Ignore other hydrological features like rain and evapotranspiration. Only the effect of the sudden change of the lake level is considered.

Consider an aquifer in direct contact with the ocean. The tide of the ocean has an amplitude of :math:`A=1.0\:\mathrm{m}` and the cycle time is :math:`T=0.5\,\mathrm{d}` (one full tide in 12h). The aquifer is confined. The aquifer has the following properties: transmissivity :math:`kD=900\,\mathrm{m^{2}/d}` and storage coefficient :math:`S_{y}=0.002`. We are only interested in the effect of the tide land-inwards. The effect of the tidal fluctuation on the groundwater head land-inward, :math:`s`, obeys the following expression:

.. _question-3-2:

Question 3
----------

Consider a well in an infinite water-table (phreatic) aquifer. Drawdowns are small compared to the thickness of the aquifer, so that :math:`kD=900\,\mathrm{m^{2}/d}` may be considered constant. The specific yield, :math:`S_{y}=0.15`, is also constant. As there are no boundary conditions, the drawdown by the well follows the Theis equation. An approximation of which is

.. math:: s=\frac{Q}{4\pi kD}\ln\left(\frac{2.25kDt}{r^{2}S}\right)

#. Derive a mathematical expression for the so-called *radius of influence*, that is, the distance beyond which the drawdown can be neglected at a given time :math:`t`. Notice that :math:`\ln\left(\cdots\right)=2.3\log\left(\cdots\right)`.

Question 2
----------

The transient drawdown of a well with a constant extraction *Q* in the case without any head boundary condition is mathematically described by the Theis well drawdown:

.. math:: s=\frac{Q}{4\pi kD}W\left(\frac{r^{2}S}{4kDt}\right)

that can be approximated by

.. math:: s\approx\frac{Q}{4\pi kD}\ln\left(\frac{2.25kDt}{r^{2}S}\right)

#. Sketch both graphs such that s is on a linear scale (downward positive) and time on a logarithmic horizontal scale. What’s the difference between the two?

#. Does the Theis drawdown reach a steady-state situation in the long run? Explain your answer.

We know the total discharge (flow) across a ring at fixed distance *r* from the well in a confined aquifer is given by

.. math:: Q_{r,t}=Q_{0}e^{-u}\mbox{, with }u=\frac{r^{2}S}{4kDt}

#. If you assume you are at a fixed distance :math:`r` from the well, could you then formulate a characteristic time for the transient phenomenon :math:`Q(r,t)` ? Explain your answer.

Below, we observe a hydrologist interpreting a transient pumping test in a confined aquifer. He/she plotted the drawdown data on a double log graph with drawdown *:math:`s`* vertically upward and :math:`t/r^{2}` horizontally. The data of this graph with the measurements was then shifted over the Theis type-curve until the best possible match was obtained. This match is shown in the figure.

Imagine the sea tide acting on a shore that has a confined aquifer inland with a constant *:math:`kD`* and *:math:`S`* in good vertical contact with the sea. The tide waves, which are characterized by *:math:`A`* and :math:`\omega`, therefore, penetrate the aquifer; they are mathematically described by:

.. math:: s_{x,t}=A\,e^{-ax}\sin\left(\omega t-ax\right)

#. As can be seen, this equation describes two simultaneous phenomena. Which are these two phenomena?

The factor *:math:`a`* in the equation was derived to be

.. math:: a=\sqrt{\frac{\omega S}{2kD}}

#. What are the parameters with their dimensions?

#. A tidal wave has a frequency :math:`\omega` of two cycles per day of 24 hours, or a cycle time :math:`T` of 12 hours. Large wind waves, however, have a cycle time of only about 12 seconds. How far does the influence of these wind waves penetrate into the aquifer compared to the influence of the tide waves?

The second part of the aquifer has the following properties: :math:`kD=1800\,\mathrm{m^{2}/d}` and storage coefficient :math:`S=0.001`. Because we consider the fluctuation of the head to be superposed on the mean head, we are only interested in the head :math:`s` relative to the mean head at every location, that is, in :math:`s\left(x,t\right)=h\left(x,t\right)-h\left(x\right)`. This head fluctuation, :math:`s,` obeys following expression:

Question 4
----------

A 300 m deep well in Jordan with borehole radius *:math:`r=0.25\,\mathrm{m}`* was drilled in a limestone aquifer to serve a refugee camp. The well was recently test pumped during one day at a rate of *:math:`Q=60\,\mathrm{m^{3}/h}`*. The head at 0, 0.01, 0.1 and 1 d after the start of the pump was 100, 135, 147 and 159 m below ground surface respectively. The pump is installed at 200 m below ground surface.

Further assume:

The estimated specific yield of this aquifer is 0.01.

The unknown transmissivity is constant.

You may use the simplified expression of transient drawdown in an infinite aquifer

.. math:: s\approx\frac{Q}{4\pi kD}\ln\left(\frac{2.25kDt}{r^{2}S}\right)

#. Estimate the transmissivity of this aquifer.

#. How much will be the drawdown after 3 years (1000 d)? Is the pump at 200 m below ground surface (i.e. 100 m below the initial water table) still deep enough to pump the water up?

#. Another well of equal size, depth and flow rate is planned at a second location in the camp at 2 km distance. How much will be the drawdown in each well after 3 years (1000 days) in this case? Assume that both wells pump for the same period. How deep should the pumps be installed to allow pumping both wells at he given rate for 3 years?

Question 2
----------

Consider an aquifer in direct contact with the ocean. The tide of the ocean has an amplitude :math:`A=1\,\mathrm{m}`\ m and cycle time is *T* = 0.5 d (one full tide in 12h).

The aquifer is confined. It consists of two parts. The first part reaches from the ocean to 500 m in land, the second part is present at more than 500 m from the ocean.

The first part of the aquifer has the following properties: transmissivity :math:`kD=900\,\mathrm{m^{2}/d}` and storage coefficient :math:`S=0.002`.

The second part of the aquifer has the following properties, :math:`kD=1800\,\mathrm{m^{2}/d}` m\ :sup:`2`/d and storage coefficient :math:`S=0.001`.

Because we consider the fluctuation of the head to be superposed on the mean head, we are only interested in the head, :math:`s`, relative to the mean head at every location, that is :math:`s\left(x,t\right)=h\left(x,t\right)-h\left(x\right)`. This head fluctuation, :math:`s`, obeys following expression:

.. math:: s=A\,e^{-ax}\cos\left(\omega t-ax\right)\mbox{, where }a=\sqrt{\frac{\omega S}{2kD}}\mbox{ and }\omega=\frac{2\pi}{T}

Drawdowns are considered small compared to the thickness of the aquifer, so that :math:`kD=900\,\mathrm{m^{2}/d}` may be considered constant. The specific yield, :math:`S_{y}=0.15`, is also constant. As there are no boundary conditions, the drawdown by the well follows the Theis equation. An approximation of which is

.. math:: s\approx\frac{2.3Q}{4\pi kD}\log\left(\frac{2.25kDt}{r^{2}S}\right)

Question 1: Pressure in confined aquifer

A water level in a piezometer in a confined aquifer is affected if the weight on a ground surface is suddenly changed. Compare two situations a) Sudden change by a load placed on the ground, such as sand or flooding by water and b) Sudden increase of the barometric pressure.

Case a: — a load is placed on ground surface

#. How does the water pressure change in the piezometer? (Up? Down? Not?)

#. How does the head change in the piezometer? (Up? Down? Not?)

Case b: — barometer pressure increased

#. How does the water pressure change in the piezometer? (Up? Down? Not?

#. How does the head change in the piezometer? (Up? Down? Not?)

General:

#. If there is a difference between the two cases, then why is that?

.. _question-2-9:

Question 2
----------

The groundwater head variation in a confined aquifer due to a tidal wave at x=0 can be expressed mathematically as follows:

.. math:: s\left(x,t\right)=\phi\left(x,t\right)-\phi_{0}+A\,\exp\left(-ax\right)\sin\left(\omega t-ax\right)\mbox{, in which }a=\sqrt{\frac{\omega S}{2kD}}

and :math:`\omega=\frac{2\pi}{T}` with :math:`T` the period of the wave.

#. What is the amplitude of the wave at distance :math:`x`?

#. What is the velocity of the wave?

#. If the wave would be just observable in a piezometer at :math:`x=1000\,\mathrm{m}` from the coast, then at what distance would the wave be just observable on another spot along the coast where the storage coefficient is be 100 times greater than at the current spot and the transmissivity is the same?

#. A tidal wave occurring daily is just observable in the aquifer at a distance of :math:`x=500\,\mathrm{m}` from shore, where :math:`x=0`. At what distance from the shore will a 14-day wave be just observable occurring due to the monthly moon cycle? Assume the same amplitude for both waves.

.. _question-3-8:

Question 3
----------

In class we discussed the somewhat complicated solution by series expansion of the evolution of the head after a sudden rain shower of :math:`P` [m] in a strip of land of width :math:`L` [m] between parallel fixed-head boundaries with water level :math:`\phi_{0}` [m]. We have seen that after some time :math:`t` [d], only the first term matters, which is

.. math:: s\left(x,t\right)=\phi\left(x,t\right)-\phi_{0}=\frac{P}{S_{y}}\frac{4}{\pi}\cos\left(\pi\frac{x}{L}\right)\exp\left(-\pi^{2}\frac{kD}{L^{2}S_{y}}t\right)

Whenever possible express your answers mathematically:

#. What is the shape of the head?

#. What is the maximum head, take :math:`\phi_{0}=0`?

#. What would you consider the characteristic time of this system?

#. What would be the half-time of this groundwater system?

Question 4: wells
-----------------

The solution by Theis is given by

.. math:: s\left(r,t\right)=\phi_{0}-\phi\left(r,t\right)=\frac{Q_{0}}{4\pi kD}\mathrm{W}\left(u\right)\mbox{, where }u=\frac{r^{2}S}{4kDt}

#. What flow conditions are described by Theis’ well solution?

#. What are its parameters and what are their dimensions?

As you know, the function W(:math:`u`) is the exponential integral, which may be written as a series expansion :

.. math:: \mathrm{W}\left(u\right)=-0.577316-\ln u+u-\frac{u^{2}}{2\times2!}-\frac{u^{3}}{3\times3!}+\frac{u^{4}}{4\times4!}\cdots

#. How can you mathematically approximate the Theis’ solution for very small values of :math:`u` given that :math:`-0.577216\approx\ln\left(0.5615\right)`?

#. With this approximation, mathematically give the difference between the drawdown obtained at time t and the drawdown at time 10t in a piezometer at some arbitrary distance r from the well.

You may use the fact that :math:`\ln10\approx2.3`.

Also give the difference between the drawdown in a piezometer at distance r from the well and in a piezometer at distance 10r from the well, both at the same time.

The head change and the head-change gradient are:

The picture below shows a strip of land of width *L* bounded by two canals. Both the strip and the canals run perpendicular to the paper (so the picture is a cross section).

#. What types of reversible storage do you know in aquifer systems, explain how it works

#. What values may you expect for the respective storage coefficients?

#. What is barometric efficiency, explain how it works.

#. When the barometric pressure increases, does the head (water table in a piezometer) in the confined aquifer rise or fall?

#. Between what values may the barometric efficiency vary?

#. What happens in a confined aquifer with the head if a load is suddenly placed on ground surface, such as a train stopping near a piezometer? What happens when it leaves? Sketch a graph showing the head versus time that you would expect in that case.

Question 2: Characteristic time of groundwater basin
----------------------------------------------------

Characteristic time of groundwater basin, the partial differential equation of which reads

.. math:: kD\frac{\partial^{2}\phi}{\partial x^{2}}=S\frac{\partial\phi}{\partial t}

#. What is a characteristic time of a groundwater basin that may be considered as one-dimensional of characteristic size *L*? (hint: Make partial differential equation dimensionless by setting :math:`\xi=\frac{x}{L}`, :math:`\tau=\frac{t}{T}` and see what :math:`T` is.

#. To reach equilibrium, how many times slower is a large basin compared to a small one with the same transmissivity and storage coefficient?

#. Compute the characteristic time for the following cases:

   #. Large basin: :math:`kD=500\,\mathrm{m^{2}/s}` , system width :math:`L=100\,\mathrm{km}`, storage coefficient :math:`S=0.2`,

   #. Small basin: :math:`kD=100\,\mathrm{m^{2}/d}`, system width :math:`L=100\,\mathrm{m}` , storage coefficient :math:`S=0.1`.

Question 3: Tides in groundwater
--------------------------------

   Given: The tidal fluctuation in an aquifer in a point at distance *x* from the sea due to the water level fluctuation at sea with amplitude *A* is described by the following formula

   .. math:: s\left(x,t\right)=A\,\exp\left(-ax\right)\sin\left(\omega t-ax\right)

   in which the damping factor is as follows :math:`a=\sqrt{\frac{\omega S}{2kD}}`, where :math:`\omega` is the angle velocity in radians/time or :math:`\omega=\frac{2\pi}{T}` where :math:`T` is the time of a complete wave cycle.

Are the following expressions true or false?

#. The wave in the aquifer has a different frequency than the tide itself.

#. The amplitude of the wave at a given distance from the sea becomes greater when,

   #. the frequency of the tide is reduced

   #. the storage coefficient is reduced

   #. then the transmissivity is reduced

Question 4: Aquifer with river
------------------------------

Consider an aquifer of infinite extent bounded by a fully penetrating river at :math:`x=0`. At :math:`t=0` the river level suddenly changes by a height :math:`A`. The change of head :math:`s(x,t)` in the aquifer equals in this case:

.. math:: s\left(x,t\right)=A\,\mathrm{erfc}\left(\sqrt{\frac{x^{2}S}{4kDt}}\right)

with :math:`\mathrm{erfc}(u)` as shown in the picture below

      :width: 80.0%

      :math:`\mathrm{erfc\left(u\right)}`\ versus :math:`u`

#. What is the final value of the head change (the value reached after infinite time, :math:`s\left(x,\infty\right)`?

#. What value has the argument of :math:`\mathrm{erfc}(\cdots)`, i.e., :math:`\sqrt{\frac{x^{2}S}{4kDt}}` when the head change is half the final value?

#. If :math:`kD=400\,\mathrm{m^{2}/d}`, :math:`S=0.1` and :math:`x=100\,\mathrm{m}`, after how much time is this the change of head equal to :math:`0.5A`?

#. What would be the formula if the head change occurred on time *:math:`t_{1}`* instead of time\ :math:`t=0`?

#. How could you compute the head change at point *:math:`x`* if the there was a sudden change of the river level of *:math:`A_{1}`* at time *:math:`t=t_{1}`* and another of *:math:`A_{2}`* at *:math:`t=t_{2}`*?

Question 5: Well in a confined aquifer
--------------------------------------

Consider a well in a confined aquifer starting an extraction of :math:`Q=1200\,\mathrm{m^{3}/d}` at :math:`t=0`. :math:`kD=1000\,\mathrm{m^{2}/d}`, and :math:`S=0.001`. For this case the Theis solution applies:

.. math:: s=\frac{Q}{4\pi kD}\mathrm{W\left(u\right)\mbox{, with }}u=\frac{r^{2}S}{4kDt}

(See the type curve of Theis well function on a separate page).

#. Compute the head at :math:`r=20\,\mathrm{m}` after :math:`t=1\,\mathrm{d}`.

#. The pump is switched off after 1 day. What is the head after 1.1 days at :math:`r=20\,\mathrm{m}`?

Question 6: Well in a leaky aquifer
-----------------------------------

Consider a transient well in a leaky aquifer. :math:`kD=400\,\mathrm{m^{2}/d}`, :math:`c=400\,\mathrm{d}`, :math:`S=0.001`, so that the groundwater behaves according to Hantush’s transient well formula

.. math:: s=\frac{Q}{4\pi kD}\mathrm{W}\left(u,\frac{r}{\lambda}\right)\mbox{, with }\lambda=\sqrt{kDc}

#. How long does it take until the head at :math:`r=40\,\mathrm{m}` becomes steady state or virtually steady state? (Hint: look at the type curves to get u for which this is the case, note).

Question 7: Well in an unconfined aquifer
-----------------------------------------

Consider a well in an unconfined aquifer for which the Theis-solution applies (see type curve hereafter. Further given a pumping test with an extraction of :math:`Q=600\,\mathrm{m^{3}/d}` during which drawdown measurements were made (see the graph with the small circles).

Interpret the test (that is: compute *kD* and *S*).

(Hint: if you can’t see through the paper make the type curve thicker using a pen and hold both curves up against a light or in the direction of a window).
