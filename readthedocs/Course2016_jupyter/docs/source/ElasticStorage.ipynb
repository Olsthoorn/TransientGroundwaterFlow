    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Till now, we only considered storage at the water table and gave very simple, but practical examples largely ignoring spatial dimensions. Spatial dimensions will be dealt with later. In this section, we handle the physics of elastic storage and will give some interesting everyday examples that are sometimes easily overlooked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic storage is the only storage occurring in confined (and semi-confined) aquifers, i.e. in aquifers without a water table, aquifer that are completely filled with water from floor to ceiling. In such aquifers we have no lowering of the water table whatsoever, unless the head is lowered to beneath the ceiling of the aquifer, a case further ignored here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, in confined aquifers storage can only result from compression of the water and depression of the aquifer. The compressibility of the water and the grains themselves is quite obvious, but often the less obvious storage is the most important part. This is the deformation of the soil skeleton, the bulk matrix or the (bulk) porous medium as it is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loading efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze the physics of elastic storage, we start with noting that the total load at any depth is carried by the total (vertical pressure) $\\sigma_{t}$ or $p$ N/m2. This total pressure must equal the sum of the vertical grain pressure (the so-called effective stress, $\\sigma_{e}$) and the water pressure $\\sigma_{w}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p=\\sigma_{e}+\\sigma_{w} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is indicated in figure [fig:The-weight-of-ground-supported-by-sigmaw+sigmae]. The brown beams and the springs are imaginary. They replace the volume $V_{0}$ (1 m3 say) that has been cut out of the aquifer. The two imaginary springs have the same properties as the water and the porous medium respectively. Let us see that happens when the pressure is increased by $\\Delta p$. Then the volume (or height) $V_{0}$ is reduced by $\\Delta V$ and the springs pressures are increased by $\\Delta\\sigma_{w}$ and $\\Delta\\sigma_{e}$ respectively. The springs have different stiffness, so $\\Delta\\sigma_{w}\\ne\\Delta\\sigma_{e}$. However each string will always carry a fixed proportion of the total stress. Se we may write\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\Delta\\sigma_{w}}{\\Delta p}=LE $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where LE is this fixed proportion and is called the loading efficiency. The LE must obviously lie between 0 and 1 and is fixed for any particular porous medium. So if we put a weight, a layer of sand for instance, on ground surface, p will increase by $\\Delta p$ equal to the weight of that sand per $m^{2}$. and $\\Delta\\sigma_{w}=LE\\,\\Delta p$. If we have a piezometer in the aquifer, the the water level (the head) will rise by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Delta\\phi=\\frac{LE}{\\rho f}\\Delta p $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now assume that $\\Delta p$ is caused by an change of the barometer pressure as is shown in the figure below. Then the same reasoning applies, as the subsoil does not know whether it is the barometer pressure of a layer of sand that causes the pressure increase.\n",

    "\n",
    "Figure: The weight of the ground plus water is supported by two pressures, the water pressure $\\sigma_{w}$ and the effective pressure $\\sigma_{e}$\n",
    "\n",
    "A nice and famous early example of loading efficiency is the impact of a train stopping at a station and leaving again some time later (figure above). The weight of the locomotive compresses the aquifer a bit, thus reducing its pore space. This in turn compresses the groundwater, which cannot readily escape. Hence, its pressure rises and it starts to flow sidewards, so that the pressure gradually decreases towards its original trend. When the train leaves, the opposite occurs. The removal of the load reduces the effective stress, which causes the aquifer to bounce back, providing more pore space to the water, which depressurizes and increases somewhat in volume. This reduced water pressure causes surrounding groundwater to flow towards to fill up the gap because of which the pressure gradually normalizes.\n",

So on the one hand the water level in the piezometer wants rise by $\\Delta\\sigma_{w}/\\rho g=LE\\Delta p/\\rho g$ as it was the case in the left picture, but at the same time it also wants to decline under the full barometer pressure that now works on its water surface, which is different from the left picture.

Only if heads are measured a short time intervals of hours rather than weeks, the noisy behavior of the head in confined aquifers actually shows its clear one-to-one relation with the course of the barometer pressure. Therefore, such a noisy time series behavior actually shows that a piezometer is in a (semi)-confined aquifer. Unless we have very thick unsaturated zones with substantial resistance against air flow, we will not see much if any barometer fluctuation in water table aquifers ([Rasmusen and Crawford (1997)])."

    "If the total pressure p is increased by $\\Delta p$, the the porous medium is compressed together with the water that it contains. Clearly, the increase of the water pressure will also compress the individual grains. However, sand grains are about 50 times harder, or stiffer, or less compressible than the water. Therefore, the effect of the grains being compressed can be safely neglected. However, the porous medium itself is far less stiff than the grains. It is compressed due to some deformation of the grains et the expense of the porosity.\n",

    "Hence the volume $V_{0}$ is compressed by $\\Delta V$ when the pressure $p$ is increased by $\\Delta p$.
