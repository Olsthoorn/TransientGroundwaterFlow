# TransientGroundwaterFlow
Transient Groundwater Flow Short Course (Module 3 at UNESCO-IHE, Delft, Netherlands)

I have given the short course Transient Groundwater Flow, analytical solutions for about 11 years. This year (2017)
I converted the text manual to a set of Jupyter notebooks, so that you do not only have dead text, but also live code, that not only I, but also you , may change and add to. Live code also facilitates issuing problems and to come up with suggetions for improvements.

The idea to use Python for the exercises in the course is based my conviction that students should nowadays learn two "things"  1) Python and 2) QGIS. Not only can you compute
and do practically everything that is possible to code and visualize within Python, but Python also allows you to cooperate worldwide with
colleagues across any boundaries, whether physical or political. Python and QGIS are for engineers and scientists what still is English for worldwide
communcation as was Latin in the Middel Ages. Pyhon and QGIS are free, so nobody can ever take it from you, no matter where you are
and who you are. It's up to you and only you to learn to use these tools. And by using these tools for any computational and visualization and spatial analysis, you're sure to become a master in it. These tools promise to be a lifelong benefit to you. The posibilities that these tools provided to you are unprecedented and offer a unique opportunity for you today, in our times.

Coming from 25 years of Matlab experience, I learned Python myself starting september 2016 and I'm still working on QGIS, but nervertheless use it regularly in diverse projects. You can be sure that I'm still not satisfied with skills with these tools, but I'm using them to my and hopefully also your benefit on an almost daily basis.

But one thing is certain, these tools and the jupyter notebooks have made it far easier and more fun to update both code and text than ever before. When referring to the notebook version of this course, working with live documents is a much more challending pleasure than having to rely on only a printed manual.
