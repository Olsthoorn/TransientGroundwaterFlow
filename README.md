# TransientGroundwaterFlow
Transient Groundwater Flow Short Course (Module 3 at UNESCO-IHE, Delft, Netherlands)

This project contains the material for the 20h course "Transient Groundwater Flow" given each year at IHE Delft
since 2006 as part of a 2-year MSc program on Hydrology.

The directory "SyllabusUpToData" is the latest version of the course' syllabus. It's a pdf that was generated from LyX the word processor used to write it.

The same directory also contains the LyX and pdf files of the written exams since 2006, both without and with answers.

The students have to do an assignment. The dictory Assignment constains the file with the latest assignments, since 2016. The workout of the assignments
can also be found in the same directory. The workouts are in the form of Ipython or Jypyter notebooks, using Python for the quantification.

Exercises are done together with the students during the course. Until 2016 they were done in Microsoft Excel. However, as from 2017, they are done
using Python in Jupyter notebooks. Also the assignment of 2016 has been redone using a Jypyter notebook.

Many exercises casen be found in the directory "Exercises_notebooks".

Futhermore, animations can be found in the directory "Animations". These anaimations are also done in notebooks. The anmations are also used in
the Powerpoint presentations used during the course in class. These PowerPoints can be found in the directory Powerpoints.

The directory `Notebooks_generating_syllabus_pictures` contains notebooks that generate pictures used in the latest Syllabus.
The names of these notebooks refer to the chapters and sections of the syllabus. 

The directory Syllabus_jupyter contains three notebooks that essentially capture the chapters 5, 6, and 7 of the Syllabus.

The directory Logo has the Logo of the IHE institute (2017). A newer version should be used.

The directory `readthedocs` contains the course as it is generated on readthedocs. There is a version `Course2022` and one `Course2016_jupyter`. The
Course2016_jupyter is the course found on ReadTheDocs, but likely not complete anymore on Github. It should be replaced by Course2022.
