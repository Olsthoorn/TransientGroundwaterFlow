# TransientGroundwaterFlow
Transient Groundwater Flow Short Course (Module 3 at UNESCO-IHE, Delft, Netherlands)

I have given the short course **Transient Groundwater Flow, analytical solutions** for about 11 years. This year (2017)
I converted the text manual to a set of **Jupyter notebooks** see end of this README for details, so that you do not only have dead text, but also live code, that not only I, but also you may change and add to. Live code also facilitates issuing problems and to come up with suggetions for improvements.

The idea to use **Python** for the exercises in the course is based my conviction that students should nowadays learn two "things"  1) **Python** and 2) **QGIS**. Not only can you compute
and do **practically everything that is possible to code and visualize within Python**, but **Python** also allows you to **cooperate worldwide** with
colleagues across any boundaries, whether physical or political. **Python** and **QGIS** are for engineers and scientists what still is English for worldwide
communcation as was Latin in the Middle Ages. **Python** and **QGIS** are **free**, so _nobody can ever take it from you, no matter where you are and who you are_. _It's up to you and only you to learn to use these tools_. And by using these tools for any computational and visualization and spatial analysis, you're sure to become a master in it. These tools promise to be a lifelong benefit to you. The posibilities that these tools provided to you are `unprecedented` and offer a unique opportunity for you today, in our times.

Coming from 25 years of `Matlab` experience, I learned **Python** myself starting september 2016 and I'm still working on **QGIS**, but nervertheless use it regularly in diverse projects. You can be sure that I'm still not satisfied with skills with these tools, but I'm using them to my and hopefully also your benefit on an almost daily basis.

But one thing is certain, these tools and the **jupyter notebooks** have made it far easier and more fun to update both code and text than ever before. When referring to the **notebook version of this course (see below)**, working with live documents is a much more challending pleasure than having to rely on only a printed manual.

**The documents of the course (in fact the syllabus) can be read at**

http://transientgroundwaterflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

or just look for transientgroundwaterflow and olsthoorn on the web to find it at the site readthedocs.

The documents that you read there are the formatted notebooks you find in the folder `/docs` on

https://github.com/Olsthoorn/TransientGroundwaterFlow

that is, when you `cloned` the course, you have them in the directory `/docs` of your clone clone foler. You can open them in `Jupyter notebook`, read them and change them to your liking, right inside the notebooks.

Also note that the pictures in read the docs are in the folder `/docs/pictures`.

You also find the following `folders in your clone of this repository`
