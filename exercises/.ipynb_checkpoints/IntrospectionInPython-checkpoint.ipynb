    "In everyday life, introspection is the act of self-examination. Introspection refers to the examination of one's own thoughts, feelings, motivations, and actions. The great philosopher Socrates spent much of his life in self-examination, encouraging his fellow Athenians to do the same. He even claimed that, for him, \"the unexamined life is not worth living.\" (See Resources for links to more about Socrates.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer programming, introspection refers to the ability to examine something to determine what it is, what it knows, and what it is capable of doing. Introspection gives programmers a great deal of flexibility and control. Once you've worked with a programming language that supports introspection, you may similarly feel that \"the unexamined object is not worth instantiating.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This article introduces the introspection capabilities of the Python programming language. Python's support for introspection runs deep and wide throughout the language. In fact, it would be hard to imagine Python without its introspection features. By the end of this article you should be very comfortable poking inside the hearts and souls of your own Python objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin our exploration of Python introspection in the most general way possible, before diving into more advanced techniques. Some might even argue that the features we begin with don't deserve to be called \"introspective.\" We'll have to agree that whether they fall under the umbrella of introspection or not is open to debate. For the purposes of this article, our only concern is finding the answers to interesting questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's begin our inquiry, using Python interactively. When we start Python from the command line, we enter the Python shell, where we can enter Python code and get an immediate response from the Python interpreter. (The commands listed in this article will should execute properly using Python3. You may get different results or errors if using an earlier version.\n",

    "Like real-world objects, several computer objects may share common characteristics while maintaining their own minor variations. Think of the books you see in a bookstore. Each physical copy of a book might have a smudge, or a few torn pages, or a unique identification number. And while each book is a unique object, every book with the same title is merely an instance of an original template, and retains most of the characteristics of the original.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same is true about object-oriented classes and class instances. For example, every Python string is endowed with the attributes we saw revealed by the dir() function. And in a previous example, we defined our own Person class, which acted as a template for creating individual Person instances, each having its own name and age values, while sharing the ability to introduce itself. That's object-orientation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer terms, then, objects are things that have an identity and a value, are of a certain type, possess certain characteristics, and behave in a certain way. And objects inherit many of their attributes from one or more parent classes. Other than keywords and special symbols (like operators, such as \\+, \\-, \\*, \\**, /, %, <, >, etc.) everything in Python is an object. And Python comes with a rich set of object types: strings, integers, floats, lists, tuples, dictionaries, functions, classes, class instances, modules, files, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have an arbitrary object, perhaps one that was passed as an argument to a function, you may want to know a few things about that object. In this section we're going to show you how to get Python objects to answer questions such as:\n",

The experienced Python programmer knows that there is always more they do not know, and are therefore not wise at all. The act of programming produces more questions than answers. The only thing good about Python, as we have seen here today, is that it does answer one's questions. As for me, do not feel a need to compensate me for helping you understand these things that Python has to offer. Programming in Python is its own reward. All I ask from my fellow Pythonians is free meals at the public expense."
