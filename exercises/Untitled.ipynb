    "# Game, behind which of 3 doors?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a famous statistical game which has often confused people. It's a beautiful example of how baysian statistics work.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a quiz there are three participants, a quizmaster and the public. The three participants can win a great price. They only have to point at one of the three doors behind which the price is. So each of the three participants makes his/her choice (independently). Then the quizmaster steps forward and opens one of the three doors. As it turns out, the price is not behind that door. Then the quizmaster asks the participants whether they like to change their initial choice or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ The first participant, who we call the \"keeper\" stands by his initial choice.\n",
    "+ The second participant, who we call the \"chooser\", makes a new choice out of the two doors.\n",
    "+ The third participant, who we call the \"changer\", simply changes her choise by choosing the other closed door.\n",
    "\n",
    "Who do you think wins after a number of games, the keeper or the changer, or doesn't it make any difference?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a famous game. It has also been presented once in the New York Times, which has cause a half-year long discussion with readers about the outcome. But what is the outcome? Which strategy wins and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we let Python play the game for us. You can set the number of games by changing N. You can also set the constant \"verbose\" to True, so that you can see the outcome of each individual game. The totalled number of wins for each candidate is printed at the end. Notice however, that if N is large, the number of lines is also large, so that you then have to do a lot of scrolling to see the outcome.\n",
