\begin_layout Chapter
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This syllabus has been prepared as part of the IHE master's program in Hydrology
 and Water Resources, at IHE Delft, The Netherlands.
 The part given by the author, i.e.
 transient analytical solutions, consists of a total of 18 lecture hours
 divided over four and a have days.
 The majority of ours will be oral lectures and a minority will be practical
 exercises in which the students learn to solve their problems by implementing
 the groundwater solutions in Python.

\begin_layout Section
Objectives of the course
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The students will become familiar with the basic 1D and axially symmetric
 transient groundwater solutions that can readily be applied in practical
 situations when a computer models is not readily available, where a fast
 idea of the effect of groundwater impacts is required, where a model is
 to be verified and so on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Students will learn how to deal with and apply superposition, which is perhaps
 the most important tool to handle more complex systems with analytically.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Students will obtain insight in the transient behavior of groundwater systems,
 and learn to reason based on their characteristics such as halftime and
 the relations between parameters and the way parameters workout in the
 effect on the system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Students will learn to simplify analytical solutions to extract behavior
 characteristics that are easy to understand and apply for under specified
 conditions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Closed analytical solutions for transient groundwater flow are only available
 for linear systems, i.e.
 systems with a constant transmissivity and storativity.
 Students will learn how to deal in an approximate way with situations where
 transmissivity will vary due to extractions or injections of water.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Students will gain insight in the behavior of real-world groundwater systems
 and learn how to read their reaction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Students will also learn what physics cause a given behavior of groundwater
 systems.
 Storage characteristics and barometric and tidal reactions will be dealt
 with.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Students will learn and exercise how to implement transient analytical solutions
 in Python and visualize their results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Students will learn how to analyze basic pumping tests to obtain the parameter
 values of a groundwater system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Depending on the group, students will learn how to handle complicated time
 varying systems by means of convolution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Students will carry out an assignment in which they apply the various aspects
 they've learned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Note with respect to the exercises
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Today, there are two skills that students should acquire: Python and QGIS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With Python, there is no limit to what you as student of professional may
 compute (and visualize) on your laptop,.
 Neither is there any practical limit to the amount of data you can handle
 and process, or the complexity you can handle.
 And, perhaps the best of it: it is free of charge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With QGIS there is no limit to the spatial data you can handle, analyze
 and process.
 And it is also free of charge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With these two tools you equip yourself for the future as an engineer or
 scientist.
 Both Python and QGIS are free, which is a unique feature of our time.
 Never before was so much computing power available to everybody.
 And, nobody can ever take it from you, just because it's free, always present
 for you to exploit it on your own laptop.
 Therefore, it is only up to you yourself to acquire the skills to use it.
 To help you, there is an immense amount of resources and information on
 the internet about both these tools, so you should never be without an
 answer to your questions.
 There are also numerous tutorials on the Internet, both written and on
 video, and, of course, there exists a large pile of books.
 Python and QGIS, which have been widely around for only about 1.5 decades,
 have already changed the world for engineers and scientists and are continuing
 to do so every day.
 So if you don't want to be left behind, pick it up.
 My advice to you, dear students, is to start using both Python and QGIS
 for all your projects from now on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The exercises for this course will be done in IPython notebooks (now called
 
\emph on
Jupyter notebooks
\emph default
), which are a terrific means to communicate your work with others, including
 your teachers.
 These notebooks, which were originally developed for Python only, have
 since a few years been extended to over 47 other computer languages, like
\emph on
 R
\emph default
 and
\emph on
 Julia
\emph default
.
 That is why the name was changed from IPython notebooks to 
\emph on
Jupyter
\emph default
 notebooks.
 These notebooks allow you to combine, text, formulas and code, neatly formatted
, while computations are done and visualized within the notebook itself.
 Therefore, if your notebook is correct, then your work is correct.
 And because the text, with formulas, code and graphical results can be
 nicely formatted within the notebook, the notebook is also a great means
 for sharing your results as a living document or, if you like, as a pdf
 document, which you can send to your teacher if he/she does not have or
 know Python.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To convince yourselves read what Nature (world's most famous scientific
 journal) said about

\begin_layout Chapter
Introduction to transient phenomena in groundwater
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Transient phenomena can only occur if there is some form of storage for
 water under pressure.
 Without storage, at least theoretically, all changes of water pressures
 would spread out with infinite speed across the entire medium.
 The studied system would then always be in steady state.
 Clearly, this is never the case in physical reality.
 Every groundwater system has ways to store and release water under changes
 of pressure.
 The specific change of water volume in the porous medium per unit change
 of pressure (or head) determines the transient behavior of the groundwater
 system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Under confined groundwater-flow conditions, part of the storage comes from
 compressibility of the porous medium and part from the compressibility
 of the water.
 Under conditions of a free water table, i.e.
 under unconfined flow conditions, meaning when a free water table is present,
 also called phreatic groundwater, most storage comes from filling and emptying
 pores above the water table and only a minor part from elastic storage.
 The elastic storage is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the phreatic
 storage.
 Because of this, elastic storage is mostly neglected for aquifer systems
 with a free water table.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Groundwater systems can be very slow and very fast.
 Whether a groundwater system is slow of fast depends on factors that we
 will study later in section

 behavior.
 In this syllabus, we will deal with reversible systems only.
 Forms of irreversible storage may nevertheless be important under specific
 circumstances, or may even be quite common.
 Therefore, we will start with an illustration of some forms of irreversible
 transient behavior of water-filled porous media.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
Irreversible transient phenomena
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Consolidation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One possible form of volume change is due to reordering of ground particles,
 which may happen due to an increase of the effective pressure (= grain
 pressure), and is characterized by the squeezing out water which leads
 to an irreversible decline of pore space.
 This phenomenon is called consolidation and leads to land subsidence.
 The effective stress, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{e}$
\end_inset

, is the pressure transmitted between the grains.
 Consolidation is especially well known for clay.
 In clay, under increased effective stress, micrometer-scale clay plates
 get reordered and the pore space thus becomes irreversibly smaller.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As long as grain stresses on vertical planes are horizontal, as is the case
 in undisturbed horizontal sediments, the total vertical stress, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{z}$
\end_inset

, (in following chapters we will often use the symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{e}$
\end_inset

, but they are the same), working on a horizontal plane in the subsoil always
 equals the total weight above this plane.
 This weight includes possible loads on ground surface.
 The total vertical stress 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{z}$
\end_inset

 itself is the sum of the water pressure, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{w}$
\end_inset

, and the effective vertical stress 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{e}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sigma_{z}=\sigma_{w}+\sigma_{e}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we increase the vertical stress, for instance by loading the surface
 with a layer of sand, or by filling a surface reservoir, or due to rainwater
 infiltrating during the winter season, both stresses will change
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta\sigma_{z}=\Delta\sigma_{w}+\Delta\sigma_{e}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the water pressure changes, while the total weight remains constant,
 as is the case when we lower the head in a confined aquifer (reflect on
 why this must be so?), then the water pressure and the effective stress
 are directly related
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
0 & = & \Delta\sigma_{w}+\Delta\sigma_{e}\\
\Delta\sigma_{w} & = & -\Delta\sigma_{e}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, if we lower the head, i.e.
 the water pressure, the effective stress increases and the water pressure
 decreases.
 This works the other way around in case the head were increased instead
 of lowered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It follows that the lowering of the water pressure puts the grains of the
 porous medium under higher stress, which may, therefore, lead to (irreversible)
 subsidence in vulnerable soils.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An increased effective stress causes a reduction of the volume of the porous
 medium and, therefore, also of its pore space.
 To compensate for this reduced space, water will be squeezed out.
 The speed at which this happens depends on the conductivity of the compressed
 layer as well as its thickness, as with thicker layers it takes more time
 for the compressed water to reach the top or bottom of the layer, from
 which the water could escape.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Large-scale groundwater extractions have, therefore, led to large subsidences
 affecting large areas in, among others, Mexico, USA and the UK (figure

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Subsidence can be relatively fast (happening within weeks) or slow (taking
 place over centuries) on local to regional scales.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Subsidence also occurs as a result of drainage of wetlands and peat areas.
 Peat means organic soil, which can decay.
 This lowering of the shallow water table also increases the effective stress
 as we saw above.
 This subsidence is especially evident in a low country like the Netherlands,
 where drainage of wetlands by ditches has taken place for about thousand
 years.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With regard to organic soils, called peat, it is not only the increase of
 the effective stress caused by drainage that causes the subsidence.
 It is also the entry of oxygen that can enter peaty soils when they are
 drained.
 This oxygen causes oxidation (a kind of natural 
\emph on
burning
\emph default
) of the peat, giving an extra boost to the subsidence.
 Subsidence caused by oxidation may continue until it all peat has disappeared!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The peaty areas in the west and north of the Netherlands have thus subsided
 several meters (figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "fig:Rising-sea-level-and-subsidence-in-the-Netherlands"

\end_inset

).
 This is why about half the Netherlands lies nowadays below sea level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In case the original soil layers consisted of alternations of peat and clay,
 as they often do, the shallow subsoil will consist more and more of pure
 clay at the top where all peat was burnt away by oxidation, with the original
 mixture still present below the water table.
 This clay layer at the top is the collection of all the clay that was present
 in the original profile, which may have been several meters thick.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Liquefaction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another irreversible phenomenon involving reordering of grains, is known
 as liquefaction, which can happen very fast and spectacularly.
 Liquefaction is associated with pressure waves, or shocks.
 Fine sand may have been at rest for thousands of years, even with its pore
 space being greater than according to the most dense packing of the grains.
 In the case of a shock, for instance due to an earthquake, the sudden change
 of water pressure may be so great as to cause the effective stress to be
 zero for a fraction of a second, during which the grains lose their mutual
 friction.
 The ground then loses its internal friction and momentarily turns into
 a quicksand.
 In fact, it suddenly becomes a dense liquid in which grains float as freely
 moving particles.
 The matrix will resettle within minutes at a smaller overall volume.
 During this resettling, the pore water no longer fits between the grains
 in their denser packing.
 As soon as the surplus water has escaped the soil resettles and everything
 sunk into the heavy liquid is stuck forever (see figure

\begin_layout Section
Intrusion of salt water
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In many regions, especially deltaic regions, fresh groundwater floats on
 saline water, which is heavier (denser) than fresh water.
 (The difference in density between fresh and ocean water is about 2.5%).
 The fresh groundwater in the Netherlands is largely floating on salt water
 as is shown in the cross section in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Dynamically-floating-fresh-water-in-the-Netherlands-cross-section"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 It will generally take several hundred years to a thousand years for a
 freshwater lens to build up from natural precipitation.
 The equilibrium may easily be disturbed by extraction of fresh water, but
 also by construction of harbors, canals and polders.
 This will cause upconing of salt water from below and lateral intrusion
 of salt water into aquifers along the coast.
 Given the time it takes to restore such systems under natural conditions,
 mining of these systems may be considered irreversible under many practical
 situations as there are no real means (or sufficient fresh water) to restore
 the systems within the time horizon of a generation.
 Good groundwater management is, therefore, essential, but hard to realize
 in situations of water scarcity.

\begin_layout Chapter
Reversible groundwater storage
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the remainder of this syllabus, we will restrict ourselves to reversible
 groundwater storage phenomena, i.e.
 phenomena in which the porous medium is not changed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In groundwater flow systems, three separate forms of storage may be distinguishe
d:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Phreatic storage, which occurs in unconfined aquifers, i.e.
 aquifers with a free water table.
 It is due to filling and emptying of pores at the top of the saturated
 zone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Elastic storage, which is due to combined compressibility of the water,
 the grains and the porous matrix (soil skeleton).
 This storage releases or stores water wherever the pressure changes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Sometimes, the interface between fresh water and another fluid (be it saline
 water, oil or gas) can provide a third type of storage.
 This works by displacement of the interface, generally between the fresh
 water and the saline water.
 When displacing an interface, the total volume of water in the subsurface
 remains essentially the same, however, the amount of usable fresh water
 may increase (or decrease) at the cost of saline water, and therefore,
 one may consider this storage of fresh water.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Phreatic storage (water table storage, specific yield, Sy)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Phreatic storage is due to the filling and emptying of pores above the saturated
 zone, i.e.
 above the water table.
 Because it is related to changes of the water table, it is limited to phreatic
 (unconfined) aquifers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The storage coefficient for an unconfined aquifer is called specific yield
 and is denoted by the symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{y}$
\end_inset

.
 It is dimensionless, as follows from its definition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
S_{y}=\frac{\partial V_{w}}{\partial h}\label{eq:specific-yield-def}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial V_{w}$
\end_inset

 is the change of volume of water from a column of aquifer per unit of surface
 area and 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial h$
\end_inset

 is the change of the water table elevation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $S_{y}$
\end_inset

, therefore, is the amount of water released from storage per square meter
 of aquifer per m drawdown of the water table.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hydrogeologists, and groundwater engineers alike, often treat specific yield
 as a constant.
 In reality, the draining and filling of pores is more complex and this
 should be kept in mind in order to judge differences of 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{y}$
\end_inset

 values under different circumstances even with the same aquifer material.
 This will be explained further down.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is no such thing as a sharp boundary between the saturated and the
 unsaturated porous medium above and below the water table.
 In fact, the water content is continuous across the water table.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
\emph on
The water table is, by definition, the elevation where the pressure equals
 atmospheric pressure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because we relate all pressures relative to atmospheric, we may say the
 water table is the elevation where the water pressure is zero (relative
 to the pressure of the atmosphere).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simplest conceptual model for the zone above the water table is a vertical
 straw or radius 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 standing with its open end in water.
 Due to adhesion between the water and the straw, the water level will be
 sucked upward in the straw against gravity, thereby reaching an equilibrium
 height 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 as shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:Straw-of-radius-r"
plural "false"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The soil itself may be considered to consist of a dense network of connected
 tortuous pores of small but widely varying diameter that may be fully or
 partially filled with water.
 Due to adhesive forces, pores may even be fully filled above the water
 table.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
In pores above the water table the pressure is negative (i.e.
 below atmospheric).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If grains can be wetted (attract water), as is generally the case with water,
 water will be sucked against gravity, into the pores above the water table
 over a certain height.
 This height mainly depends on the diameter of the pores.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One can immediately compute the equilibrium of the water in the pore.
 We have gravity pulling down the water column reaching above the water
 table, and we have the cohesion force.
 Hence,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\rho gh\pi r^{2}=2\pi r\gamma\cos\left(\alpha\right)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 [kg/m 
\begin_inset Formula $^{3}$
\end_inset

] is the density of water, 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 [N/kg] is gravity, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 [N/m 
\begin_inset Formula $^{2}$
\end_inset

] is the cohesion stress, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 the angle between the cohesion stress and the vertical.
 Hence,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h=\frac{2\gamma}{\rho gr}\cos\left(\alpha\right)
\]

\end_inset

which shows that the suction height 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 is proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $1/r$
\end_inset

, the inverse radius of the straw.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In practical situations, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is small so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma\cos\alpha\approx\gamma$
\end_inset

.
 As 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 points is in the direction of the surface tension 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 (see figure  
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Straw-of-radius-r"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) where the water surface meets the wall of the straw, we also have
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tau\approx\gamma
\]

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 the surface tension of the water surface, which equals 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=75\times10^{-3}\mathrm{N/m}$
\end_inset

, see any physical handbook or look it up on Wikipedia.
 Therefore, we can compute the suction head 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 immediately given a pore radius.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
h & \approx & \frac{2\tau}{\rho gr}
\end{eqnarray*}

Numerically,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
h & \approx & \frac{150\times10^{-3}}{10^{4}}\frac{1}{r}\\
 & \approx & \frac{1.5\times10^{-5}}{r}\mathrm{\left[m\right]}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we express 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 in mm, (using 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{*}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r^{*}$
\end_inset

 to indicate mm), we get
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h^{*}=\frac{15}{r^{*}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This implies that water in a pore of 1 mm radius may be sucked up over about
 15 mm, and water in a pore with a radius of 0.1 mm over 15 cm and water
 in a pore with a radius of 0.01 mm radius over 1.5 m.
 In reality, the suction may be 50% smaller because of the angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 that was ignored here.

 This implies that the line of filled pores will not be sharp.
 Therefore, the saturation above the water table will gradually decline
 as shown in the right-hand figure .
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The diameter of the widest pores will determine the height fully saturated
 above the water table, i.e.
 the thickness of the so-called capillary fringe.
 In gravel, the capillary fringe will be almost zero, but it may be several
 decimeters or even meters thick in fine-grained materials such as fine
 sand, loess, loam and clay.
 In sands, the capillary zone is usually 15-30 cm thick, depending on the
 grain size.
 The thickness of the capillary zone is sometimes visible as a wet zone
 in the banks of surface water.
 Note that all water above the water table is under negative pressure.

Drainage of water from column after lowering the water table
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the water table is lowered, for instance in a column of sand, and we
 measure the amount of water drained over time, we see that drainage is
 not immediate (figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Drainage-of-water-from-column-after-lowering-water-table"

\end_inset

).
 After a couple of days, the drainage rate becomes negligibly small.
 We may thus call the amount drained during a couple of days the specific
 yield.
 It is immediately obvious that specific yield is not a unique physical
 parameter.
 The more time we take, the higher the specific yield becomes.
 It implies that the duration of the test determines the value to some extent.
 It also implies that a specific yield, when determined from a pumping test
 of a couple of days duration, is likely to be smaller than that determined
 from the seasonal fluctuation of the water table.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the amount of water drained from the subsurface due to lowering of
 the water table is called
\emph on
 specific yield
\emph default
, the amount retained is the soil is called the
\emph on

.
 Together they add up to the soil's porosity (figure

\emph on
 Specific retention

, i.e.
 the amount of water the soil can hold against gravity.
 It is defined is the amount of water retained in an originally saturated

The porosity of porous materials varies, but that of sands is often about
 35%.
 Fine sands tend to have somewhat higher values, while coarse sands tend
 to have somewhat lower porosities (see figure

).
 This is related to the ease of compaction at the original time of sedimentation.
 Smaller grains have a higher surface area and are, therefore, more difficult
 to compact.
 In natural gravels, the pore space is often filled by finer grains.
 This reduces the porosity further.

 shows that for very fine sands, the specific yield declines despite the
 higher porosity.
 This is mainly due to the higher specific retention (field capacity) of
 the finer-grained materials (figure  
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Moisture-content-versus-pressure-head"

) as well as to the lower hydraulic conductivity of such fine materials,

These curves relate the moisture content to suction head, i.e.
 the negative head in the pores.
 Figure  
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Moisture-content-versus-pressure-head"

\end_inset

 gives the general shape of these curves for typical soil materials.
 Therefore, in the case of perfect equilibrium between suction and gravity,
 the moisture characteristic curves represent the moisture content in the
 soil above the water table.
 The moisture content at 200 cm suction is generally taken as the field
 capacity.
 For sandy soils, the moisture content at this suction head is a good measure
 of the amount of water the soil can hold against gravity under free drainage
 conditions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This implies that the moisture content depends on the distance to the water
 table (i.e.
 the suction).
 Hence, the ground surface above a shallow water table tends to be wetter
 than above a deep water table under otherwise the same circumstances.
 This must influence the specific yield as illustrated in figure

 The specific yield times the difference of the two water tables equals

We should thus not be surprised to find that the same fine dune sand may
 have a specific yield of 22% inside a large dune area, where the water
 table is usually several meters below ground surface, and only 8% in an

 only 60 cm below ground surface.

Soil characteristics may vary between wide limits.

 A complication is that the moisture characteristic curves differ during
 wetting and drying.
 This phenomenon is called hysteresis, but this is beyond this course.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Groundwater hydrologists dealing with saturated groundwater usually just
 use a single constant value for the specific yield in their formulas and
 models.
 The specific yield can be estimated from the soil in question, from moisture
 characteristic curves, in the laboratory, from field measurements, from
 pumping tests or groundwater-model calibration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though this approach may seem doubtful or just wrong in the eyes of
 some, using a constant but appropriately chosen specific yield works remarkably
 well in practice.
 It is more a matter of realizing oneself when a constant specific yield
 of a certain value is not applicable.

If the specific yield is known, evapotranspiration rates can sometimes be
 determined from such water-table registration.
 This can be demonstrated on the hand of these old measurements (figure

 The groundwater balance at this point may be expressed as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\overline{N}+N\left(t\right)=S_{y}\frac{\partial\phi}{\partial t}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{N}$
\end_inset

 is the long-term trend of the net water-table recharge (positive or negative,
 i.e.
 precipitation minus evapotranspiration from the water table).
 
\begin_inset Formula $N\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 is the short-term variation (during the day).
 So if one plots the derivative of the water table in a point versus time,
 it may be split into a more or less constant (long-term) trend and a the
 remainder due to short-term (daily) variation.
 If this short-term variation can be attributed to evapotranspiration from
 the water table, as it obviously is the case in the figure , one may determine
 it by taking the surface area between the measured head curve and its long-term
 trend, multiplied by the specific yield (hatched surface in figure

\begin_layout Section
Elastic Storage
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Till now, we only considered storage at the water table and gave very simple,
 but practical examples largely ignoring spatial dimensions.
 Spatial dimensions will be dealt with later.
 In this section, we handle the physics of elastic storage and will give
 some interesting everyday examples that are sometimes easily overlooked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Elastic storage is the only storage occurring in confined and semi-confined
 aquifers, i.e.
 in aquifers without a water table, meaning aquifers that are completely
 filled with water from floor to ceiling.
 In such aquifers, we have no lowering of the water table whatsoever, unless
 the head is lowered to beneath the ceiling of the aquifer, a case further
 ignored here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, in confined aquifer storage can only result from compression
 of the water and depression of the aquifer.
 The compressibility of the water and the grains themselves is quite obvious,
 but often the less obvious storage is the most important part.
 This is the deformation of the soil skeleton, the bulk matrix or the (bulk)
 porous medium as it is called.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Loading efficiency
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To analyze the physics of elastic storage, we start with noting that the
 total load at any depth is carried by the total (vertical pressure) 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{z}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $p\,\mathrm{N/m^{2}}$
\end_inset

.
 This total pressure must equal the sum of the vertical grain pressure (the
 so-called effective stress, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{e}$
\end_inset

) and the water pressure 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{w}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p=\sigma_{e}+\sigma_{w}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is indicated in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:The-weight-of-ground-supported-by-sigmaw+sigmae"

\end_inset

.
 The brown horizontal beams and the springs in this figure  are imaginary;
 they replace the volume 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}$
\end_inset

 ( 
\begin_inset Formula $1\mathrm{m^{3}}$
\end_inset

 say) that has been cut out of the aquifer.
 The two imaginary springs have the same properties as the water and the
 porous medium respectively.
 Let us see what happens when the pressure is increased by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta p$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In that case, the volume (or height) 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}$
\end_inset

 is reduced by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta V$
\end_inset

 and the springs pressures are increased by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\sigma_{w}$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\sigma_{e}$
\end_inset

 respectively.
 The springs have a different stiffness, so 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\sigma_{w}\ne\Delta\sigma_{e}$
\end_inset

.
 However, each string will always carry a fixed proportion of the total
 stress.
 Therefore, we may write
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta\sigma_{w}=LE\,\Delta p
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $LE$
\end_inset

 is this fixed proportion and is called the
\emph on
 loading efficiency
\emph default
.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $LE$
\end_inset

 must obviously lie between 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 and 1 and is fixed for any particular porous medium.
 So if we put a weight, like a layer of sand, on ground surface, 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:The-weight-of-ground-supported-by-sigmaw+sigmae"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 will increase by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta p$
\end_inset

, a change that is equal to the weight of the layer of sand per 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{m}^{2}$
\end_inset

 placed on ground surface.
 We may then say 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\sigma_{w}=LE\,\Delta p$
\end_inset

, where the loading efficiency 
\begin_inset Formula $LE$
\end_inset

 is a fixed number between 0 and 1, specific to a aquifer in question.
 If we have a piezometer in the aquifer, we'll notice that the water level
 (hence, the head) has risen by placing the sand on ground surface.
 The head rise is given by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta\phi=\frac{LE}{\rho g}\Delta p
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta p$
\end_inset

 is not due to a layer of sand placed on ground surface, but due to a change
 of the barometer pressure as in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:LE-BE-barometer"

\end_inset

.
 Then the same reasoning applies, because the subsoil cannot know the difference
 between a pressure change due to a layer of sand placed on ground surface
 or due to an equivalent rise of the barometer pressue.

A nice and famous early example of loading efficiency is the impact of a
 train stopping at a station and leaving again some time later (figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:ToddsTrain"

\end_inset

).
 The weight of the locomotive compresses the aquifer a bit, thus reducing
 its pore space.
 This in turn compresses the groundwater, which cannot readily escape.
 Hence, its pressure rises and it starts to flow sidewards, so that the
 pressure gradually decreases towards its original trend.
 When the train leaves, the opposite occurs.
 The removal of the load reduces the effective stress, which causes the
 aquifer to bounce back, providing more pore space to the water, which depressur
izes and increases somewhat in volume.
 This reduced water pressure causes surrounding groundwater to flow inward
 to fill up the gap due to which the pressure gradually normalizes.

As said above, for the pressure in the aquifer there is no difference between
 the two pictures.
 However, there is a difference between the head (i.e.
 the water level) in the piezometer in the left picture and in that of the
 right picture.
 When placing a layer of sand on ground surface, the pressure on the water
 surface in the piezometer does not change.
 However, when the the barometer pressure changes, the pressure on the water
 surface in the piezometer does change.
 That change is, of course, exactly equal to the change of the barometer
 pressure.
 To see how the head changes due to a change of the barometer pressure let
 us just write out the water pressure at the bottom of the piezometer.
 It is clear that this pressure changes due to the change at ground surface
 such that

The minus sign indicates that the head in the piezometer declines when the
 barometer goes up.
 This should be obvious as the the water pressure increases by 
\begin_inset Formula $LE\,\Delta a$
\end_inset

 which is a fraction of the barometer pressure, which would cause the water
 level in the piezometer to rise, but at the same time the full barometer
 pressure pushes on the water table in the piezometer, which causes the
 water level to decline accordingly.
 Together, the net effect is a decline of the head in the piezometer by

 However, barometer effects are always seen in piezometers in confined aquifers.
 The barometer efficiency generally varies between 20% and 80%.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The barometer influence causes a normally observed noisy behavior of the
 head time series from confined and semi-confined aquifers.
 This noisy behavior occurs also when groundwater is in perfect rest.
 Barometer pressure fluctuations do affect both the head measured in piezometers
 as the pressure measured in pressure gauges.
 Only if heads are measured at short time intervals of hours rather than
 weeks, would the noisy behavior of the head in confined aquifers actually
 show its clear one-to-one relation with the course of the barometer pressure.
 Therefore, such a noisy time series behavior actually shows that a piezometer
 is in a (semi-)confined aquifer.
 Unless we have very thick unsaturated zones with substantial resistance
 against air flow, we will not see much if any barometer fluctuation in
 water-table aquifers

\begin_layout Standard
If the total pressure 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is increased by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta p$
\end_inset

, the porous medium is compressed together with the water that it contains.
 Clearly, the increase of the water pressure will also compress the individual
 grains.
 However, sand grains are about 50 times less compressible than water.
 Therefore, the effect of the grains being compressed themselves can be
 safely neglected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, the porous medium (the skeleton of grains) itself is
 far less stiff than the grains themselves.
 The porous medium is essentially compressed due to some deformation of
 the grains at the expense of the porosity of the medium.
 In fact, as it turns out, the compressibility of the porous medium is of
 the same order of magnitude as that of the water, so they must both be
 taken into account.

Assume the aquifer to be of infinite lateral extent, so that the only possible

 Similarly, let the porous medium have a compressibility of

Because the grains are considered incompressible, it follows that the change

 Therefore, for the water we have a relative volume change (= compression)

it is the volume of water released from the porous medium per m of lowering
 of the head 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 (a negative

 It is also immediately clear that the dimension of

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now consider the situation in which we lower the water pressure, for instance
 by extracting water from the aquifer.
 Lowering of the water pressure in no way changes the total pressure.

However, the amount of water squeezed out of the porous medium changes.
 A lowering of head causes an increase of the effective pressure (grain
 pressure), and, hence, is associated with a compression of the porous medium.
 Therefore, an increase of the effective pressure (

\begin_inset Formula $\Delta V$

 in this case (see equation

 Clearly,

 There is some dependency on dissolved components, water containing dissolved

\begin_inset Formula $V_{T}$

 is, the total volume of the considered soil (including its pores).
 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{e}$

 is the effective stress (=grain pressure), i.e.
 that part of the total stress, 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

, that is not carried by the water pressure 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{w}$
\end_inset

 The total pressure equals the weight of the overburden, i.e.
 that of the overlying formations including the water that they contain.
 Hence 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{e}=p-\sigma_{w}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The soil compressibility 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 is the gradient of a stress-strain curve (relative volume change as a function
 of effective stress) of a dry soil sample put under increased stress in
 the laboratory, such that side-ward movement is prevented, exactly as it
 is the case in the actual aquifer under uniform vertical stress.
 Unlike water, the compressibility of soil is not necessarily a constant.
 If the soil is put under higher stress than it had ever supported before,
 then it consolidates, meaning that the change of volume is largely irreversible.
 But under lower than historic stresses, a constant compressibility can
 be determined, and truly elastic behavior can be assumed.
 It should be clear, that this compressibility depends on porosity.

Even far from the ocean and even after correcting for varying barometer
 pressures, the groundwater head in confined aquifers may show a response
 that closely resembles tides.
 This fluctuation matches the passage of the sun and the moon due to a rotating

Like normal tides, earth tides are an indirect consequence such gravity
 variations.
 It can be shown that they are caused as an indirect effect of the deformation
 of the earth's mantle on which the stiff crust floats.
 A bulge is formed by the mantle by the attraction of the sun and the moon.
 The earth crust itself is so thin compared to the earth mantle that it
 behaves like a thin hard sheet floating on the mantle and is stretched
 by the mantle as it bulges out under tidal attraction.
 During stretching, porosity increases and the head lowers.
 When the stretching is released, the opposite occurs as is shown in equation

 The dilatation (stretching) is more or less fixed due to the relation with

Scope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this course, we will deal with transient groundwater flow in one-dimensional
 and radial situations (wells) for which analytic solutions are available.
 Analytic solutions are important because they allow insight in the behavior
 of the groundwater system, whereas numerical solutions do not; they only
 produce numbers.
 Analytic solutions are also important because they allow checking numerical
 models and checking numerical models is always necessary, not just because
 of possible errors in the model, but also because of possible errors in
 the input of the model.
 Analytical solutions also allow analysis of numerical models, which helps
 to understand their outcome.
 Finally, analytical solutions are powerful because they allow a rapid result
 with minimal input.
 They become even more powerful if combined with superposition and convolution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Governing equations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will always start our discussion with the governing differential equation
 at hand.
 Once we have it, we need to solve it.
 To be able to do that we need boundary conditions specifying fixed heads
 or fixed discharges along certain parts of the model boundaries.
 In the case of transient solutions, we also need initial conditions that
 specify the head everywhere in the considered domain at time zero.
 Initial and boundary conditions are as important as the differential equation
 itself.

 Nevertheless, we limit ourselves in this course to single-layer cases.

Further notice that we may write

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $s\left(x,t\right)$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also notice that often

 the elevation of the water table and

This means that for 1D groundwater dynamics, we will mostly work with solutions
 of the following partial differential equation where

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:diffusion-equation-in-s"

\end_inset

 is known as the diffusion equation.
 It appears in many scientific fields like like diffusion, dispersion, heat
 conduction, sorption, consolidation, etc.
 Many researchers have derived solutions for this partial differential equation
 for specific boundary and initial conditions.
 The coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $S/kD$
\end_inset

 is called the diffusivity, often written as a thick D, like 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{D}$
\end_inset

, which always has dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{\left[L^{2}/T\right]}$
\end_inset

 whatever the scientific application is.
 The diffusivity is the ratio of the ease of the flow (transmissivity) and
 the storage:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbb{D}=\frac{kD}{S}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the case of a phreatic (unconfined, water-table) aquifer, the aquifer
 thickness is no longer constant.
 Unfortunately, there are no transient solutions that take a time-varying
 aquifer thickness into account.
 Linearization is then unavoidable, meaning that one has to choose a proper
 average aquifer thickness (or transmissivity) and remain vigilant that
 the head change should remain small with respect to the saturated thickness
 of the aquifer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The partial differential equation can also be viewed in this basic left-hand

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
kD\frac{\partial^{2}s}{\partial x^{2}}=S\frac{\partial s}{\partial t}
\]

\end_inset

in which the left-hand side describes the flow in the aquifer and the right-hand
 side the storage.
 To readily understand and let sink in the meaning of this partial differential
 equation, it is perhaps easiest to integrate both sides over a distance
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x$
\end_inset

 to get
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

kD\intop_{x}^{x+\Delta x}\frac{\partial^{2}s}{\partial x^{2}}dx=S\intop_{x}^{x+\Delta x}\frac{\partial s}{\partial t}dx

which equals
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This clearly shows that the left-hand side is the net inflow of a piece
 with length 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x$
\end_inset

 (having dimension [L 
\begin_inset Formula $^{2}$
\end_inset

/T] or [L 
\begin_inset Formula $^{3}$
\end_inset

/T] per unit length perpendicular to the cross section of the aquifer, hence
 [L 
\begin_inset Formula $^{2}$
\end_inset

/T], while the right-hand side equals the storage over the same aquifer
 distance with 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 [L 
\begin_inset Formula $^{3}$
\end_inset

/L 
\begin_inset Formula $^{2}$
\end_inset

/L] (volume per unit of aquifer surface area per unit of head increase per
 unit of time).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also notice that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial^{2}s}{\partial x^{2}}
\]

\end_inset

is the curvature of the head.
 Whenever that is positive, there is an net inflow at the considered location
 originating from the aquifer adjacent to the considered point or infinitesimall
y small section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally notice that we can replace the head change 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 (normally used for (semi-)confined aquifers) by the absolute head 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 (normally used for water-table aquifers).
 This makes absolutely no difference as only the derivatives of 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 play a role in the equation, which are the same.
 Just read 
\begin_inset Formula $s$

 as head difference relative to some initial or average condition.

Groundwater fluctuations due to sinusoidal tides
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A number of transient problems can be analyzed by assuming sinusoidal water-leve
l or flow fluctuations at a boundary, at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

 say.
 Generally, the resulting heads and flows within the aquifer will then also
 behave like a sine which will have the same frequency.
 If we have the analytic solution for head or flow in the aquifer due to
 harmonic fluctuating at the boundary, we may solve many related and more
 complex problems by superposition, that is by combining solutions of arbitrary
 frequencies, amplitudes and phase shifts.
 This way, hourly, daily, weekly and seasonal fluctuations may be readily
 combined.
 Examples of applications are tides in groundwater en the depth penetration
 of temperature fluctuations at ground surface.

 At 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

 this aquifer is in direct connection with a surface-water body with a fluctuati
ng water level, which causes fluctuations of head and flow in the adjacent
 aquifer, which are delayed and dampened relative to the forced fluctuation
 at

 sinusoidal with the same frequency (same angular velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$

What is the velocity of the wave, or what is the delay of the wave at any
 distance 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 from the sea or river?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To find the answer, we move along with the wave such that the phase is constant,
 e.a.
 equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

.
 Hence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\omega t-ax+\beta_{0}=c
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then determine the velocity by computing 
\begin_inset Formula $dx/dt$
\end_inset

.
 So
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\omega-a\frac{dx}{dt}+0=0
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This leads to
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
v=\frac{dx}{dt}=\frac{\omega}{a}\label{eq:wave-velocity}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The delay of the wave at any 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 relative to the wave at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

 is then
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
t=\frac{x}{v}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The wave velocity can be measured in figure  
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 as the velocity of the top of the sines in the third figure .
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alternatively, one may say, that when the argument must be constant, it
 doesn't matter which constant, but only constant, then we can just well
 say that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\omega t-ax=0
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
so that immediately we have 
\begin_inset Formula $x/t=\omega/a$
\end_inset

, which is the same answer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
How much is the wavelength in the ground?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A direct approach is taking the argument of the sinus and demanding that
 the argument of the sine at 
\begin_inset Formula $t+T$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is the cycle time) is the same as the argument of the sine at 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 but at location 
\begin_inset Formula $x+\Delta x$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\omega\left(t+T\right)-ax+\beta_{0}\right]=\left[\omega t-a\left(x+\Delta x\right)+\beta_{0}\right]
\]

\end_inset

hence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\omega T=a\Delta x=0
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta x & = & \frac{\omega}{a}T
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

noting that the cycle time equals 
\begin_inset Formula $T=\frac{2\pi}{\omega}$
\end_inset

, we get
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta x_{full\,wave}=\frac{2\pi}{a}
\]

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $a=\sqrt{\frac{\omega S}{2kD}}$
\end_inset

, we also have
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta x_{full\,wave}=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{2kD}{\omega S}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, the larger 
\begin_inset Formula $kD$
\end_inset

 the longer the wave length, the larger the 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 the shorter and the larger the 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

, the shorter the wavelength will be, which all makes sense.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have now seen that the head is indeed a damped sine.
 The damping is stronger for higher frequencies, larger storage coefficients
 and lower conductivities.
 It's difficult to measure the wave length from the upper figure  in figure
  
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:sines_head_vs_x_and_vs_t"
plural "false"

\end_inset

 because the damping is so strong that essentially full damping takes place
 within a single wavelength.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Using characteristic time and length
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The solution may be more intuitively expressed using characteristic time
 and length.
 The charactersitci time would be the cycle time, 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 it takes for one full tide to complete
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\omega T=2\pi\rightarrow T=\frac{2\pi}{\omega}\rightarrow\omega=\frac{2\pi}{T}\rightarrow\omega t=2\pi\frac{t}{T}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also, we could set a characteristic length of the tide the aquifer to
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lambda=\frac{1}{a}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The envelopes are thus now expressed as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
-A\,e^{-\frac{x}{\lambda}}\le s_{x,t}\le+A\,e^{-\frac{x}{\lambda}}
\]

\end_inset

so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 now is the length over which the maximum amplitude declines by a factor
 
\begin_inset Formula $e\approx2.3$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The relation with the length over which the amplitude declines by exactly
 a factor 2 is easily derived
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
e^{-\frac{x+\Delta x}{\lambda}} & =0.5e^{-\frac{x}{\lambda}}\\
-\frac{x+\Delta x}{\lambda} & =\ln0.5-\frac{x}{\lambda}\\
\Delta x & =\left(\ln2\right)\,\lambda\\
\Delta x & \approx0.69\,\lambda
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As always when we have an exponentially declining relationship, we can define
 a half-time or half-length.
 That halftime or half-length is always 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln\left(2\right)\approx69\%$
\end_inset

 of the characteristic time of characteristic length, i.e.
 the time or length in which the exponent declines by a factor 
\begin_inset Formula $e\approx2.3$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The characteristic length of the tidal wave in the aquifer is, therefore
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lambda=\frac{1}{a}=\sqrt{\frac{2}{\omega}\frac{kD}{S}}=\sqrt{\frac{T}{\pi}\frac{kD}{S}}
\]

\end_inset

and the half-length is just 69% of this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Filling in the characteristic length and time gives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h_{x,t}=A\,e^{-\frac{x}{\lambda}}\sin\left(2\pi\frac{t}{T}-\frac{x}{\lambda}+\theta\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If one wishes to express all terms within the argument of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\sin$
\end_inset

 in terms of the full tidal cycle, one would write
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h_{x,t}=A\,e^{-\frac{x}{\lambda}}\sin\left(2\pi\left(\frac{t}{T}-\frac{x}{2\pi\lambda}+\frac{\theta}{2\pi}\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This directly shows that the distance 
\begin_inset Formula $x=2\pi\lambda$
\end_inset

 is the length of a full wave in the subsurface, and, therefore, the expression
 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi\lambda/T$
\end_inset

 is the velocity of the wave in the subsurface.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
v=\frac{2\pi\lambda}{T}=\frac{2\pi}{T}\sqrt{\frac{T}{\pi}\frac{kD}{S}}=\sqrt{\frac{2\times2\pi}{T}\frac{kD}{S}}=\sqrt{\frac{2\times2\pi}{2\pi}\omega\frac{kD}{S}}=\sqrt{2\omega\frac{kD}{S}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
v=\frac{2\pi\lambda}{T}=\omega\sqrt{\frac{2}{\omega}\frac{kD}{S}}=\frac{\omega}{a}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
which is, what we already derived in paragraph 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 This all seems needlessly complicated, but the take-home message is, that
 thinking in terms of cycle time and characteristic length is easier for
 the human mind and can be immediately translated to the field situation,
 while 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 and the damping and delay factor 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 really provide far little inspiration.

\begin_layout Subsection
Fluctuations of temperature in the subsurface
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For heat conduction in the subsurface, the same partial differential equation
 (also called
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

diffusion equation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) applies if we replace head change by temperature change.
 The only thing that changes is the so-called diffusivity 
\begin_inset Formula $kD/S$
\end_inset

.
 The ease of flow, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $kD$
\end_inset

 with groundwater flow, is now replaced by the heat conduction 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\,\mathrm{\left[W/m\right]=\left[\left(\left(E/T\right)/L^{2}\right)/\left(K/L\right)\right]=\left[E/\left(TKL\right)\right]}$
\end_inset

 and the storage is replaced by the heat capacity 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho c\,\mathrm{\left[E/L^{3}/K\right]}$
\end_inset

.
 The dimension is again 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{\left[L^{2}/T\right]}$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbb{D=}\frac{\lambda}{\rho c}\,\mathrm{\left[\frac{E/\left(TKL\right)}{E/\left(KL^{3}\right)}\right]=\left[\frac{L^{2}}{T}\right]}
\]

\end_inset

Notice that in the dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 = energy, 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 = time, 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 = length, 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 = temperature (from Kelvin).
 Because both the heat conduction and the heat capacity consist of a contributio
n from both the water and the grains (solids) of the aquifer, we can compute
 them as a porosity-weighted combination of these contributions.
 With 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 for porosity we then have
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\lambda & = & \epsilon\lambda_{w}+\left(1-\epsilon\right)\lambda_{s}\\
\rho c & = & \epsilon\rho_{w}c_{w}+\left(1-\epsilon\right)\rho_{s}c_{s}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\,\mathrm{\left[M/L^{3}\right]}$
\end_inset

 is density and 
\begin_inset Formula $c\,\mathrm{\left[E/\left(MK\right)\right]}$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 heat per kg solids per degree kelvin (= degree Celsius).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The heat capacity of saturated sandy soils is about 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=3\,\mathrm{W/m/K}=3\,\mathrm{J/s/m/K}$
\end_inset

.
 The specific heat capacity of water is 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{w}=4018\,\mathrm{J/kg/K}$
\end_inset

 and that of sand grains 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{s}\approx800\,\mathrm{J/kg/K}$
\end_inset

.
 With 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{s}\approx2650\,\mathrm{kg/m^{3}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon\approx35\%$
\end_inset

 we get 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho c=2.85\times10^{6}\,\mathrm{J/m^{3}/K}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The diffusivity then becomes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbb{D}=\frac{\lambda}{\rho c}=\frac{3}{2.85\times10^{6}}=1.06\times10^{-6}\,\mathrm{m^{2}/s}=0.091\,\mathrm{m^{2}/d}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From which we have
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
a=\sqrt{\frac{\omega}{2\mathbb{D}}}=\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{T\mathbb{D}}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With these values, one can compute between what values the temperature varies
 at any given depth as a function of the cycle time.
 For instance, the temperature fluctuation due to daily, weekly, monthly
 or yearly temperature fluctuations at ground surface.
 These envelopes are defined by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{mean}-A\,\exp\left(-az\right)\le temp\le T_{mean}+A\,\exp\left(-az\right)
\]

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 [K] the temperature fluctuation amplitude at ground surface.

The monthly temperature in the Netherlands varies between 3.1 
\begin_inset Formula $^{o}$
\end_inset

C in January and 17.9 
\begin_inset Formula $^{o}$

 The yearly amplitude is thus 7.4 
\begin_inset Formula $^{o}$
\end_inset

C; the year mean temperature being 10.5 
\begin_inset Formula $^{o}$
\end_inset

C.
 Using this, we can compute the temperature envelopes, that is, the lowest
 and highest temperatures between which the actual temperature will vary.
 figure  
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Temperature-envelopes-in-subsurface"

\end_inset

 shows the results, as computed for the same mean temperature and the same
 amplitude but for different cycle times as indicated in the legend.
 With these data, the yearly temperature variation will barely reach 20
 m below ground surface.
 Ten-year temperature fluctuations will penetrate down to about 50 m and
 30 year temperature variation would be recordable down to about 100 m.
 This implies that climate change may be measured using the change of the
 temperature at for instance 50 m below ground surface if measurements in
 the past are available, as is actually the case in the Netherlands.

\begin_layout Subsection
Concluding remarks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The derived partial differential equation applies to both groundwater flow
 and heat conduction.
 The only change is that head change is replaced by temperature change,
 transmissivity by heat conductance and the storage coefficient is replaced
 by heat capacity.
 Both heat conductance and heat capacity can be computed as a porosity weighted
 average of the contribution of the water and of the grains.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sinusoidal analysis is useful to study the impact of ongoing fluctuations
 of the input on the groundwater.
 It is straightforward to compute the head and temperature envelopes defining
 the limits of a given sine input at a given distance or depth.
 Often, this is enough he understand the physics and estimate potential
 impact.
 Most importantly it is enough the understand the relation between the different
 parameters that play in this setting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More complicated inputs can be constructed as a sum of a number of sin (or
 cosine) fluctuations, each with its own amplitude, frequency and phase
 shift.
 In fact, any input can be so constructed, although this may require the
 summation of many waves.
 On the other hand a given i.e.
 measured input may be split into individual waves using Fourier Analysis.
 Python has modules for that.
 This helps to find the dominant ones, and allows limiting the following
 analysis on only a few dominant waves.
 This simply means that this sinusoidal solution of the partial differential
 equations offers many ways to analyze groundwater systems of the type we
 considered.
 By superposition, these analysis can also be combined with other features
 such as wells.

Non-fluctuating interaction with surface water
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the previous section, we discussed the effect of sinusoidal variation
 of the level of a surface water that is in direct contact with a confined
 or unconfined aquifer.
 In this chapter, we'll discuss the same hydrological setting, but in which
 the surface water level changes suddenly by a fixed amount.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Basins of half-infinite lateral extent
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Again, we consider a confined aquifer in direct contact with surface water
 as was done in the previous section.
 The situation is depicted in figure  
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 The aquifer thickness, transmissivity and storage coefficient are everywhere
 the same.
 The aquifer is half-infinite, which means that its right end extends to
 infinity.
 We consider the aquifer as confined, because we will assume that its thickness
 is the same everywhere and stays so.
 This is required only to allow a closed analytical solution for the time-depend
ent groundwater flow.
 There are no time-dependent closed analytical solutions for water-table
 aquifers in which the transmissivity varies along with the head and, therefore,
 with time.
 We further assume the aquifer being in direct contact with the surface
 water.
 This implies that there is no hydraulic resistance of any kind between
 the surface water and the aquifer.
 This assumption keeps the analysis simple.
 However, solutions exist that take hydraulic resistance between the surface
 water and the aquifer into account as outlined in

\begin_layout Standard
We present here a basic analytical solution, which describes the change
 of head (and flow) caused by a sudden change of the surface-water level
 by an amount 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 [m].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the confined case we use the elastic storage coefficient, 
\begin_inset Formula $S=DS_{s}$
\end_inset

 and in the unconfined case we use the specific yield, 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{y}$
\end_inset

.
 In cases where we consider unconfined aquifers, the effective thickness
 of the aquifer changes along with the water table, and, therefore, also
 with the head.
 However, as long as the change of head is small compared to the thickness
 of the aquifer, we may still apply the solution in practice and accept
 the small error caused by the assumption of constant thickness.

Because superposition applies (due to linear governing partial differential

Hence, the solution of the head change versus distance to the shore always
 has the shape of this curve, be it that the horizontal axis will be squeezed
 or stretched depending on the values of the parameters in 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

.
 The shorter the time, the larger 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

, the more compressed is the horizontal axis.
 A small 
\begin_inset Formula $kD$
\end_inset

 or large 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 also has the effect of compressing the horizontal axis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the understanding it is convenient to express 
\begin_inset Formula $u=x/L$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $L=\sqrt{4kDt/S}$
\end_inset

, which is a constant for any fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 For this fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 may be considered a characteristic distance, as it scales 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 For instance, half of the initial head change has been reached when 
\begin_inset Formula $u\approx0.5$
\end_inset

 that is at a distance 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0.5L$
\end_inset

.
 Also, the head change is about 10% of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $u=1$
\end_inset

, that is at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=L$
\end_inset

, with 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 fixed for the time of observation.
 No head rise has yet occurred for about 
\begin_inset Formula $u=2.5$
\end_inset

, hence, for 
\begin_inset Formula $x>2.5L$
\end_inset

.
 This is all practical information when judging an actual situation, without
 the need for a computer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The solution is only valid for 
\begin_inset Formula $u>0$
\end_inset

, this is clear for 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{2}$
\end_inset

 under the square root and 
\begin_inset Formula $t>0$
\end_inset

.
 But when we express 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $u=x\sqrt{\frac{S}{4kDt}},$
\end_inset

this is not so obvious.
 However 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is must be positive and seen as the distance from the point of consideration
 to the boundary with the head change.
 So in case this boundary as a coordinate 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{b}$
\end_inset

 and our point of consideration is 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{0}$
\end_inset

 we should use 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\left|x_{0}-x_{b}\right|$
\end_inset

 in the formula of 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

, hence, treat 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 as a distance, being always positive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is also possible to plot 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{erfc}\,u$
\end_inset

 and its derivative versus 
\begin_inset Formula $1/u^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 To make the graph meaningful, we have to use a logarithmic scale for 
\begin_inset Formula $1/u^{2}$
\end_inset

 as is shown in figure  
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:erfcand-its-derivative-versus-1overu"

\end_inset

.
 The time scale is then proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 We can write 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{2}=T/t$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $T=x^{2}S/\left(4kD\right)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 can be considered a characteristic time for fixed distance 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 We see that for 
\begin_inset Formula $t/T\approx2$
\end_inset

, about half the final (maximum) head change has been reached.
 It is useful and practical to consider this graph from the perspective
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $t/T$
\end_inset

 instead of just 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 Taking this perspective, one only needs a single graph to cover all possible
 cases; the only thing that changes when choosing another observation point
 is the value of the characteristic time 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 can be considered time characteristic for the situation at a chosen distance
 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 The graph in figure  
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:erfcand-its-derivative-versus-1overu"

\end_inset

 also shows that some time elapses before the influence of the river reaches
 the observation point.
 The value of 
\begin_inset Formula $1/u$
\end_inset

 for this time is about 0.4 as can be read from figure  
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:erfcand-its-derivative-versus-1overu"

\end_inset

.
 Hence, 
\begin_inset Formula $t/T=0.16$
\end_inset

.
 This result is also universal.
 90% of the final head is reached at about 
\begin_inset Formula $1/u^{2}=100$
\end_inset

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $t=100T$
\end_inset

.

Example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For instance, the water level in Lake Nasser in Egypt has risen by 60 m
 between the mid 1960s, when the dam at Aswan was closed, and the end of
 the 1980s, when the new lake was full.
 This boils down to rise of the lake level of about 3 m/year.
 Just assume that the bordering aquifer is 200 m thick and that it has a
 conductivity 
\begin_inset Formula $k=1\,\mathrm{m/d}$
\end_inset

 and a specific yield 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{y}=0.1$
\end_inset

.
 How far would the effect of the filling of the lake reach in the adjacent
 aquifer? How much lake water would have been stored in that aquifer in
 that same period?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using the expression and setting 
\begin_inset Formula $n=2$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A=3$
\end_inset

 m/y, we have
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s\left(x,t\right)=A\,t^{n/2}\frac{\mbox{i}^{n}\mbox{erfc}\,u}{\mbox{i}^{n}\mbox{erfc}\,0}\mbox{, with }u=\sqrt{\frac{x^{2}S}{4kDt}}\mbox{ and with }A=3\,\mathrm{m/y}\mbox{ and further }n=2
\]

\end_inset

This specifies a linear rise of the lake level over time.
 With 
\begin_inset Formula $n=2$
\end_inset

 we get
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s\left(x,t\right)=A\,t\frac{\mbox{i}^{2}\mbox{erfc}\,u}{\mbox{i}^{2}\mbox{erfc}\,0}\mbox{, with }Q\left(x,t\right)=\sqrt{\frac{kDS}{4t}}A\,\frac{\mbox{i}^{1}\mbox{erfc}\,u}{\mbox{i}^{2}\mbox{erfc}\,0}

With proper values of

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$

 The top figure  shows the head in the aquifer as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 for different times.
 The middle figure  shows the infiltration at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

 as a function of time.
 The bottom figure  shows the development of the head over time at different
 distances from the lake bank.
 Note that the lake level remains constant after 
\begin_inset Formula $t=20$
\end_inset

 years.
 The head at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

, therefore, remains equal till the lake level reaches a total rise of 60
 m thereafter.
 After that, the lake level is kept constant.
 The infiltration 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 then sharply declines because the head does not rise further.
 This reaching of a constant lake level is implemented by superimposing
 the solution for a lake with a water level that declines with the same
 speed (i.e 
\begin_inset Formula $A=-3$
\end_inset

 m/y) starting at the moment the top lake-level is reached.
 It is a good exercise to implement this yourself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, the same case can be simulated using the function for a sudden
 rise of the lake level.
 But then the actual gradual rise of the lake level must be subdivided into
 many small sudden steps, the result of which must be added together (i.e.
 superimposed) to obtain the overall solution.
 The results is shown in figure  
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 The rise of the head and lake are shown in the lower picture, the flow
 at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

 is shown in the picture in the middle.
 The results are essentially the same, but the infiltration at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

 fluctuates quite heavily under the discrete yearly sudden head increments
 of 3 m each.
 At larger distances, however, these steps damp out.
 Of course, the smaller the steps, the smoother the result will be.
 This example shows that it may be much more convenient and require less
 work to directly apply the solution for the linear rise of the head at
 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

 Compute the change of head in the aquifer at 1 km from to the lake.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s\left(x,t\right)=A\,\mathrm{erfc}\sqrt{\frac{x^{2}S}{4kDt}}\mbox{, with }t\ge0\mbox{, where }s\left(x,t\right)=0\mbox{ for }t<0

\begin_layout Standard
The head change 
\begin_inset Formula $s\left(x,t\right)$
\end_inset

 due to an arbitrary sudden change of the surface-water level by an amount
 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{i}$
\end_inset

 happening at 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{i}$
\end_inset

 can be obtained by superposition as usual.
 Using 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 as an event index, we then get
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s\left(x,t\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left\{ dA_{i}\,\mathrm{erfc}\sqrt{\frac{x^{2}S}{4kD\left(t-t_{ci}\right)}}\right\} \mbox{, with }t\ge t_{i}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each term is nonexistent, hence zero, for 
\begin_inset Formula $t<t_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 The surface-water level at any time is 
\begin_inset Formula $s\left(0,t\right)=\sum_{1}^{N}dA_{i}\mbox{, with }t>t_{ci}$
\end_inset

, because each sudden change of water level is supposed to last forever
 after it happened at 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{ci}$
\end_inset

.
 This way, one can compute the head change and, of course, the flow in an
 aquifer due to an arbitrary variation of the surface water level at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

.
 Of course, if the surface water would vary continuously, like one or more
 
\begin_inset Formula $sine$
\end_inset

 functions, one would rather use the solution for a sine boundary head to
 simplify the computations.
 Even a combination is possible, because superposition applies.
 Notice that the time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 in the expression above is the simulation time and will be represented
 in the computer by an array of times at some arbitrary constant interval,
 while the time 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{ci}$
\end_inset

 the
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

change
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

-time will be a series of times at which the surface-water level at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

 changes.
 The values 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{ci}$
\end_inset

 are independent of the 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 values, and the number of change times is is usually much less than the
 number of 
\begin_inset Formula $t$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will simply compute the head due to the sudden head change

 at

Groundwater basins as land strips of limited width between straight head

\begin_layout Subsection
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In many practical situations, groundwater basins will have a limited width
 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 extending to infinity.
 Examples are groundwater basins that are bounded by a fixed-head boundary
 on either side.
 This includes basins that are closed on one side, because such a line of
 no flow is just the water divide, which is equivalent to a symmetrical
 basin of double width having the same head boundary on either side.

\begin_layout Standard
Often, watersheds can be regarded as a set of sub-basins bounded by river
 branches on either side of the water divide between them (see figure  
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Map-of-the-Brahmaputra-basin"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The basins considered here, can be regarded as a simplification of the
 groundwater system between two river branches, but also as a parcel of
 arable land bounded by two ditches.
 It's just a matter of scale.
 The basins considered here may, therefore, be as narrow as a parcel of
 arable land or a meadow between ditches as one can find anywhere in the
 Netherlands of perhaps 100 m wide; but they can just as well be a strip
 of land land between brooks or tributaries that are several km apart, between
 river branches tens of km apart or a desert of which the boundaries lie
 at several hundred of km from each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, the surface waters bounding most basins are not straight lines.
 Nevertheless, we limit ourselves to in this course to basins that are bounded
 by two parallel straight head boundaries.
 This makes the flow essentially one-dimensional when we ignore resistance
 due to vertical flow components with in the aquifer.
 The latter is very often justified because the vertical flow components
 are small compared to the horizontal ones.
 If this assumption is not valid like near a shallow surface-water body,
 where flow lines bend upward and convergence causing an extra loss of head,
 we may always add such effects separately.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the following sections, we'll learn how to compute the variation of head
 and flow in one-dimensional basins (basins in which the only spatial dimension
 is 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and not 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

, that are affected by the head changes at their two head boundaries, see
 figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Head-after-sudden-rise-left-and-right"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) which shows such a basin (a strip of land) bounded on either side by a
 surface-water body in direct contact with the aquifer, such that the water
 level of these surface-water bodies determine the head at either side of
 the basin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We first consider the case where the left-hand boundary head suddenly rises
 by a fixed amount 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 m, while the right-hand boundary head is kept the constant (see figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Confined-groundwater-basin-left-rise"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 We will see that maintaining the right-hand head boundary at zero, requires
 superposition of the effect of an infinite number of
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mirror
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 strips of land.
 After that, we consider a given change of head on either side of the strip.
 This case is also solved by by superposition of an infinite number of equally
 sized land strips.
 The case in which the sudden head change is the same on either side of
 the land strip is just a special one.
 However, it allows us to compare it with a different general solution describin
g the drainage of a strip of land in which the head is initially uniform
 at a level 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 above its two boundaries.
 Both solutions are equivalent although they look mathematically completely
 different.
 The latter solution, however, allows drastic simplification when time is
 large enough and gives us a time constant that is characteristic of the
 basin, which allows analyzing time characteristics of any basin with a
 simple expression.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mentioned superposition of an infinite number of strips leads to superpositi
on patterns that are shown below the respective figure s.
 These patterns allow immediate recognition of the correctness of the superposit
ion pattern required handle the head boundaries on both ends of the basin
 or the strip of land we want to analyze.

\begin_layout Standard
However, this solution will cause the head at point 
\begin_inset Formula $B$

 to start rising after some time, while in reality the head should remain
 0 at point B.
 How wan we deal with this mathematically?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we forget the surface water at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=B$
\end_inset

, but instead assume a ditch at a distance 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 to the right of point B, in which the water level was suddenly lowered
 at 
\begin_inset Formula $t=0$
\end_inset

 by an amount 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 m (i.e.
 changed by an amount - 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

), then the rising an point B due to the ditch at 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 would be exactly counterbalanced (neutralized) by the decline in point
 B due to the ditch at a distance 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 to the right of point B.
 As a consequence of both, the head at point B remains zero, which is exactly
 the desired effect.
 In this case, we have one mirror ditch with opposite head change at distance
 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 to the right of point B.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, this one mirror ditch does not solve the whole problem, because
 after some more time, it will cause the head at point A to start declining,
 and so the head at point A would not remain fixed at the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 m.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To compensate for that, we need another mirror ditch at distance 
\begin_inset Formula $2L$
\end_inset

 to the left of point A with opposite head change compared to to the first
 mirror ditch.
 But this head change at 
\begin_inset Formula $2L$
\end_inset

 left of point A will cause the head at 
\begin_inset Formula $2L$
\end_inset

 to the right of point B to change over time.
 This requires a mirror ditch at 
\begin_inset Formula $4L$
\end_inset

 to the left of point A to neutralize this effect.
 And so on.
 We will, therefore, end up with an infinite number of mirror ditches just
 to make sure that boundary conditions at both sides of our initial basin
 are kept that their desired values.

 The darker yellow block represents the original basin of width

 Each arrow represents a mirror ditch and its direction show whether the
 water level in it goes up or down.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is this solution with the shown scheme of mirror ditches correct? Well,
 this is.
 In fact, it's easy to see its correctness at a glance.
 Just look at the lower picture in figure  
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Confined-groundwater-basin-left-rise"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and consider point B, in which the head should remain zero.
 As it should become immediately clear by inspection, each ditch with lowered
 water level to the right of point B is exactly canceled at B by each ditch
 at the same distance to the left of point B with a rising level.
 Hence, the effect in point B of all ditches to the right is exactly canceled
 by all ditches to the left of point B.
 Therefore, the head at point B remains at zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, all ditches to the right of point A are exactly compensated
 at point A by all ditches to the left of point A, except for the ditch
 at point A itself.
 Hence, the total effect of all the mirror ditches together at A is zero,
 so that the only remaining effect at A is that of the level rise at A itself.
 That too can be seen at a glance from the lower picture in figure  
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

With respect to the origin of the

 in the formula is correct for each of the mirror wells.

We can use these distances directly in the formula that sums the effect

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the second term in the formula for 
\begin_inset Formula $s\left(x,t\right)$

 has a minus sign because of the water level in the right-hand ditches was
 lowered.
 However, the second term in the formula for the discharge 
\begin_inset Formula $Q\left(s,t\right)$
\end_inset

 has a plus sign, because both the left-hand and the right-hand ditches
 cause a positive flow, i.e.
 a flow in the positive direction of the

We may choose any point as the origin of the x-axis.

 So that the distance between the first well a the right

 shows the strip and the mirror ditches.
 By looking at this picture, it should immediately be clear that this scheme
 of mirror ditches is correct.
 To see this, look at point A.
 You will then notice that each ditch to the left of A is compensated exactly
 by each ditch at the right of A.
 Therefore, the only effect of all the ditches at point A, including the
 ditch at pint A itself, is that of the ditch at point A itself; all others
 cancel at point A.
 Next focus on point B and notice that this is also true for point B.
 Hence, at point A, the only effect that remains is that of the head change
 in the ditch at point A, and at point B, the only effect that remains at
 point B is that o the head change of the ditch at point B.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With this in mind, it becomes straightforward to write the expression for
 the head within the strip of land.
 To do that, just consider a point

 and write the distance to all the ditches in terms of strip width 
\begin_inset Formula $L$

Another perspective, drainage of a basin in which the head is initially

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This case, in which the water level at both boundaries suddenly rises by
 the same amount of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 m, can also be regarded as a transient drainage after a heavy shower of
 rain on the strip.
 If we assume that the rain surplus 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 [m] reaches the water table immediately, then the water level in the entire
 strip would suddenly rise by the amount 
\begin_inset Formula $A=\frac{P}{S_{y}}$
\end_inset

 in which 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 is the rain (that part of it that reaches the water table) and 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{y}$
\end_inset

 is the specific yield.
 Therefore, after such a shower, the head in the entire strip would suddenly
 be at 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 m above the water level in the ditches on either side.
 Immediately after this shower, assumed to be of zero duration, the strip
 starts draining.
 The picture that is thus obtained is the same as that in which the ditches
 suddenly rise by 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 m at 
\begin_inset Formula $t=0$

Symmetrical drainage from a land strip bounded by straight head boundaries
 (characteristic time of flow basins)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here we introduce a solution for the drainage of a land strip that initially
 has uniform head 
\begin_inset Formula $s\left(0,x\right)=A$
\end_inset

 and is bounded by two straight head boundaries at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\pm b$
\end_inset

 with head at 
\begin_inset Formula $s\left(\pm b,t\right)=0$
\end_inset

.
 This solution looks completely different from the one we obtained by infinite
 mirroring of strips of land as we did in the previous sections, yet it
 provides the same result for the symmetrical case.
 The advantage of this form of the solution is that it can be further analyzed
 to deduce general drainage patterns and their time scale.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This behavior is characteristic for a basin after a sudden shower causing
 the head in it to suddenly rise everywhere by the same amount, while the
 level in the ditches at both sides is kept the same.
 After the shower, the drainage sets in and gradually continues until equilibriu
m is finally reached (which theoretically takes infinite time).

Equation

\end_inset

 looks complicated at first, but it can be broken down to yield useful and
 practical insights pertaining to the dynamic characteristics of draining
 groundwater basins.
 For that purpose, we analyze the expression under the summation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Formula $2j-1$
\end_inset

 is just the series 
\begin_inset Formula $1,3,5,7,\dots$
\end_inset

.
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(-1\right)^{2j-1}=+1,-1,+1,-1,\dots$
\end_inset

.
 Next, we have a product of a cosine and an exponent.
 The cosine will fluctuate between -1 and +1 and it only depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 Then notice the exponent, which only depends on time.
 For simplicity write it as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\exp\left[-\left(2j-1\right)^{2}\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{2}\frac{t}{T}\right]
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $T=\frac{b^{2}S}{kD}$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 may thus be regarded as a characteristic time of the drainage.
 The exponent terms in the series now become
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\exp\left(-\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{2}\frac{t}{T}\right),\,\exp\left(-9\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{2}\frac{t}{T}\right),\,\exp\left(-25\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{2}\frac{t}{T}\right),\,\dots
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{t}{T}>0$
\end_inset

, the second and higher terms will finally become much smaller than the
 first and may, therefore, be neglected when 
\begin_inset Formula $t>t_{n}=nT$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 needs to be estimated.
 So let us see when the second term becomes much less than the first one,
 so that only the first term matters and we can neglect all higher terms.
 Therefore, compare the first term with the second and demand that it's
 much larger than the second:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\exp\left(-\pi^{2}\frac{t}{T}\right)\gg\exp\left(-9\pi^{2}\frac{t}{T}\right)
\]

\end_inset

or
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\exp\left(-\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{2}\frac{t}{T}\right)=G\,\exp\left(-9\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{2}\frac{t}{T}\right)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 is just a large positive number.
 We may choose 
\begin_inset Formula $G=100$
\end_inset

, which means, we neglect all higher terms, when the first term is at least
 100 times a large as the second.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Taking the logarithm at both sides of the equal-sign yields
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
-\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{2}\frac{t}{T}=\ln G-9\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{2}\frac{t}{T}
\]

\end_inset

Hence, we obtain
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
8\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{2}\frac{t}{T}=\ln G
\]

\end_inset

so that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{t}{T}=\frac{\ln G}{8\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{2}}=\frac{\ln100}{8\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{2}}\approx0.23
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This way, for the chosen value of 
\begin_inset Formula $G=100$
\end_inset

, we find 
\begin_inset Formula $t=0.23T$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, we conclude that all higher terms are negligible when 
\begin_inset Formula $t>0.23\,T$
\end_inset

.
 Of course, we could also have chosen another large value of 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

, but the outcome would not be much different because 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 is under the logarithm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This means that when 
\begin_inset Formula $t>0.23T$
\end_inset

 the expression given above reduces to only one term
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s\left(x,t\right)=A\frac{4}{\pi}\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\frac{x}{b}\right)\exp\left(-\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{2}\frac{t}{T}\right)\mbox{, with }t>0.23T\mbox{, and }T=\frac{b^{2}S}{kD}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a simple-to-understand expression.
 It is a cosine that only depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, not on time, with its top equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{4}{\pi}A$
\end_inset

 in the center where 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

 and zero where 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\pm b$
\end_inset

.
 This cosine-shaped groundwater mound gradually declines according to the
 exponent that only depends on time, not in 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An exponential decline can always be characterized by its so-called halftime.
 The halftime is the time in which the head reduces by a factor 0.5.
 So if 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 increases by one halftime, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t_{50\%}$
\end_inset

, the head 
\begin_inset Formula $s(x,t)$
\end_inset

 is reduced to 
\begin_inset Formula $0.5\times s\left(x,t\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To obtain this halftime, just write down mathematically that half the head
 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is obtained at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t+\Delta t_{50\%}$
\end_inset

.
 So literally
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
0.5\exp\left(-\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{2}\frac{t}{T}\right)=\exp\left(-\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{2}\frac{t+\Delta t_{50\%}}{T}\right)
\]

\end_inset

Taking the logarithm on both sides yields
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\ln0.5-\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{2}\frac{t}{T}=-\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{2}\frac{t+\Delta t_{50\%}}{T}
\]

\end_inset

and so
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\ln0.5 & = & -\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{2}\frac{\Delta t_{50\%}}{T}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

and, therefore,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\Delta t_{50\%}}{T}=\left(\frac{2}{\pi}\right)^{2}\ln2\approx0.28
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
or
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta t_{50\%}\approx0.28T\mbox{, where }T=\frac{b^{2}S}{kD}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This implies that when time progresses by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t_{50\%}=0.28T$
\end_inset

, the drawdown is halved (under the condition that 
\begin_inset Formula $t>0.23T$
\end_inset

 when all higher terms can be neglected).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This result allows us to immediately compare the halftimes of the free drainage
 of groundwater basins of widely different sizes and with widely different
 aquifer properties.
 Let the size of the basin be expressed by its representative half-width
 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

.
 Of course, when a groundwater basin does not have has the shape of a long
 strip bounded by two straight canals, one should estimate a reasonable
 half-width based on the distance from the water divide to its drainage
 base, be it ditches, canals, streams, lakes, rivers or the coast.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Charactersitic-times-of-various-groundwater-basins"

\end_inset

 gives the characteristic time 
\begin_inset Formula $T=b^{2}S/kD$
\end_inset

 and the halftime 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t_{50\%}=0.28T$
\end_inset

 for some groundwater basins.
 This table illustrates, that different groundwater basins that may have
 similar transmissivities and storage coefficients, may still have extremely
 large differences in half times or characteristic times.
 Especially the effect of the width of the basins, 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

, is large because it works to the power 2 in 
\begin_inset Formula $T=b^{2}S/kD$
\end_inset

.
 This way, a simple meadow or arable field in the Netherlands bounded between
 two ditches just 100 m apart may have a halftime in the order of one day,
 but large systems, notably deserts, like the Kalahari may have a halftime
 in the order o 10000 years.
 This implies that the small meadow in the Netherlands, will hardly remember
 the rain shower that fell one week ago, while the Kalahari is still draining
 the water that it collected during previous wet episodes may thousands
 of years ago, like the last ice age.
 Recent research with respect to the world's largest aquifer, the Nubian
 sandstone, showed that this aquifer, which extends over much of Sudan,
 Egypt and Libya, may be regarded as a water-table aquifer that is still
 slowly draining the water that it collected during wet episodes when the
 Sahara was still wet (especially between the beginning of the Holocene
 era until about 4600 years ago,

 and that the current oases represent the last remains of the water table
 reaching above ground surface, and which was much higher thousands of years

Transient flow to wells
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This chapter deals with the flow to wells in aquifers.
 The flow to a well is treated as axially symmetric and horizontal.
 Vertical resistance to flow within the aquifer itself is neglected in this
 course.
 This is the so-called Dupuit-Forchheimer approximation.
 It is a very useful approximation because it allows computing regional
 groundwater flow in aquifers accurately in a vertically integrated manner
 by considering the flow to be horizontal (or more exactly: by neglecting
 the resistance to vertical flow).
 This way, we don't have to deal with head losses due to vertical flow component
s.
 Important vertical components may, however, occur in the vicinity of wells
 that only partially penetrate the aquifer.
 Disturbances of the essentially horizontal flow due to partial penetration
 of well screens is, however, only important in the vicinity of the wells,
 at distances less that 1.5 times the aquifer thickness, and can be dealt
 with by a correction on the drawdown as will be outlined in the facultative
 section

We will handle more complicated situations, such as well fields and wells
 near specific boundaries, by superposition of mirror wells.
 By the way, also partial penetration is effectively handled by superposition.

We start this chapter with an overview of the analytical solutions that
 we will deal with and their related steady-state versions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the past, the actual computation of groundwater-flow solutions by looking
 up the values if the functions in tables.
 Nowadays, because everyone has access to powerful computational software
 like Excel or Python, we will compute the values of the different well
 functions using those it, rather than looking them up in tables.
 However, tables remain extremely important as a means to verify our own
 numerical implementation of solutions and functions.
 Further, not all required mathematical functions may be available in our
 actual computational program, especially not in Excel.
 In that case we can implement those functions ourselves.
 This may be done in Excel using Visual Basic.
 However, in the exercises of this course we'll use the much more powerful
 Python language inside digital notebooks.
 Notice that Python is freely available and can be downloaded from the Internet.
 Generally, only a few lines if Python code are needed to implement and
 use the most important transient groundwater-flow solutions and apply superposi
tion in time and or in space to handle more demanding situations.

The next three figure s provide an impression of what wells are, without
 entering into the details of their construction or the installation of
 pumps, pump cellars, electricity and so on.
 What matters for us, is the position of the screen inside the aquifer.
 There exist numerous types of wells: open wells, dug wells, drilled wells,
 tube wells, horizontal wells and more.
 In this course, we limit ourselves to wells of small radius, in which water
 storage inside the well-bore can be neglected.
 This limitation suffices for most practical situations.
 Many more solutions for special cases can be found in

\begin_layout Standard
Figure  
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Tube-well-confined"

\end_inset

 gives a sketch of a tube well in a (semi)-confined aquifer.
 The difference between a confined and a semi-confined aquifer, is that
 the top and bottom of the confined aquifer are both impervious (there is
 no vertical leakage), while the semi-confined aquifer has vertical leakage
 through its ceiling, its floor or both.
 The screen, i.e.
 the perforated portion of the well is considered to be fully penetrating
 the (wet) thickness of the aquifer, see figure  
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:A-tube-well-unconfined"

\end_inset

.
 The well's screen is not completely penetrating the aquifer in figure 
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Tube-well-confined"

\end_inset

.
 This is very often the case in practice, where well screens only partially
 penetrate the aquifer because this saves drilling, material and installation
 costs where the aquifers are much thicker than is necessary for the designed
 extraction rates.
 It should be noted however, that due to partial penetration of a well screen,
 the streamlines in the vicinity of the screen will no longer be all horizontal.
 The concentration of the streamlines towards the top and the bottom of
 a partially penetrating well screen causes extra head loss relative to
 the situation with a fully penetrating well screen.
 This head loss can be taken into account when necessary as outlined in
 the facultative section

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to realize that flow due to an extraction by a well in a
 water-table aquifer or a perfectly confined aquifer of infinite lateral
 extent will never reach equilibrium; it will always remain transient.
 The reason is that all the water has to come from storage.
 Or more precisely, the extraction by itself does not cause any water external
 to the aquifer to enter the aquifer.
 Even rain does not have any effect on the drawdown caused by the extraction.
 Of course, rain does change the head in the aquifer, but this change is
 completely independent of the extraction from the well.
 This recharge has an effect that can be superimposed independently from
 the that caused by the extraction.
 Only when a well extraction causes water to flow across aquifer boundaries
 as an effect of the gradients created by the well extraction, can the flow
 reach an equilibrium, i.e.
 steady state after a limited time.
 Therefore, a continuous extraction from a confined aquifer of infinite
 extent never reaches steady state, but a continuous extraction from a semi-conf
ined aquifer does reach steady state, as does an extraction by a well in
 an aquifer that is bounded by some fixed-head boundaries.
 Of course, if the flow through the semi-confined layer drains higher-up
 layers or even an overlying marsh, then this steady-state situation may
 not be reached, or it cannot be maintained for a very long time as the
 overlaying swamp itself would be drained by the leakage created by the
 well extraction in from the aquifer below.
 In that case, we will see a delayed yield, which is outlined in the facultative
 section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 In practice, it is always important to realize that extraction from a semi-conf
ined layer may drain overlying layers such that the head in or above the
 overlying layer will also decline, which in turn will cause the induced
 leakage through the confining layer to decline and even stop entirely over
 time.
 The more the leakage declines due to the delayed drainage of overlying
 layers, the more the head in the aquifer will start behaving like a confined
 or unconfined layer without vertical leakage but with the specific yield
 of the overlying layer as its storage coefficient, hence the expression

Governing partial differential equations are important as they express the
 physical foundation and the approximations made to solve a problem analytically
 as well as numerically.
 They will be presented further down.
 However, the general relation between solutions for a water-table aquifer
 and a confined aquifer is presented first.

The transmissivity in a water-table aquifer is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $T=kh$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 is the distance from the water table to the bottom of the aquifer; while
 in the derivation of solutions the bottom of the aquifer is assumed to
 be horizontal.
 The transmissivity of a confined aquifer is 
\begin_inset Formula $T=kD$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 its thickness and the transmissivity, which is assumed constant.
 In an unconfined aquifer, the thickness and head 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 depends on distance between the water table and the bottom of the aquifer.
 In a water-table aquifer, the thickness does in fact vary with the water
 table as it changes due to the pumping, and perhaps also due to other factors
 like varying boundary conditions.
\end_layout

It should be noted that there exist no analytical solutions dealing with

\begin_layout Standard
To allow an analytical solution for a transient groundwater problem to be
 found, the governing partial differential equation is linearized before
 solving it.
 Superposition can then be applied using the solutions of the linearized
 partial differential equation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Superposition allows us to add up an arbitrary number of different solutions
 to the same groundwater system in order to handle more complex situations.
 When the underlying governing partial differential equation is linear,
 the effect of individual wells remain completely separated from effects
 of other factors or boundary conditions.
 This implies that precipitation and evaporation play no role when it comes
 to computing the changes of the groundwater heads and flows caused by wells.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This simplification may fail when the groundwater system does not obey the
 assumptions that underlie our partial differential equation.
 This is the case, for example, when plant evaporation is reduced in a
\series bold
 nonlinear
\series default
 fashion by the drawdown of the water table.
 One should keep such exceptions in mind when solving practical problems
 and stay aware of the limitations to the calculation methods and formulas
 applied.
 Of course, the same is true when applying groundwater models.

\begin_layout Standard
Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Overview-of-the-groundwater-well-solutions"

\end_inset

 shows the most important groundwater-well solutions.
 Only the first one in the table deals with a water-table aquifer; all other
 well solutions require the transmissivity to be constant.
 To use these solutions for water-table aquifers, the drawdown must remain
 small compared to the wet aquifer thickness; it may not change by more
 than say 20% of the original aquifer thickness.
 However, one may often overcome such conditions by using a proper average
 for the aquifer thickness.
 The water-table solution in the table depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{2}-H^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Note that this can be converted into a product of the drawdown and the
 aquifer thickness as follows
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
h^{2}-H^{2}=\left(h-H\right)\left(h+H\right)\approx2sH=2sD\label{eq:h2-H2=2sH}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By replacing 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{2}-H^{2}$
\end_inset

 in the first solution by 
\begin_inset Formula $2sH$
\end_inset

 one obtains the second.
 Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:h2-H2=2sH"

\end_inset

 also gives a clue with respect to the accuracy of using a confined-aquifer
 solution for the water-table case, which we will often do in practice.
 It requires that 
\begin_inset Formula $h+H\approx2D$
\end_inset

.
 A head change of 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 of 20% of 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 therefore, causes an error in the computed drawdown of about 
\begin_inset Formula $10\%$
\end_inset

, which is acceptable under most circumstances.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Clearly, the second Thiem solution in the table below is directly related
 to the transient Theis solution, but they are not equivalent, because the
 Theis solution has no steady state.
 However, the difference between the transient heads at two finite distances
 from the pumping well does become steady state over time, and that steady
 state is equivalent to the Thiem solution for constant aquifer thickness.
 The steady-state solution for the flow to a well in a leaky aquifer, according
 to De Glee (1930) in the table, is the steady-state equivalent of the transient
 solution of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Also notice that
\series bold
 all
\series default
 steady-state solutions have a 2 in the denominator of the factor multiplying
 the well function or the logarithm, while
\series bold
 all
\series default
 transient solutions have a 4 at that position.
 From this, it immediately follows that the Hantush solution for 
\begin_inset Formula $t\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

 is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

\frac{Q}{4\pi kD}\mbox{W}_{h}\left(u_{t\rightarrow\infty},\frac{r}{\lambda}\right)=\frac{Q}{2\pi kD}\mbox{K}_{0}\left(\frac{r}{\lambda}\right)

Theis and Hantush wells in an infinite aquifer with constant transmissivity
 and storativity; the governing partial differential equation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 1935, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "TheisC1935"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 published a new solution for the dynamic change of head 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 [m] caused by a well that, at 
\begin_inset Formula $t=0$
\end_inset

, begins pumping at a constant rate 
\begin_inset Formula $Q\,\mathrm{[L^{3}/T]}$
\end_inset

 from an infinite aquifer having uniform transmissivity 
\begin_inset Formula $kD\,\mathrm{[L^{2}/T]}$
\end_inset

 and storativity 
\begin_inset Formula $S\,\mathrm{[-]}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The solution by Theis has been a major breakthrough in groundwater hydrology.
 For the first time, it became possible to analyze the dynamics of the heads
 and flows caused by extracting wells.
 Before Theis, only steady-state flow solutions for the groundwater flow
 to wells existed, which very much limited possible analyses of actual pumping
 regimes.
 According to Theis, when a well pumps from an aquifer of infinite extent,
 all water must come from storage; there are no extra sources of the extracted
 water.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, 20 years layer 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Hantush1955"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 developed an analytical solution for the flow to a well in a semi-confined
 aquifer.
 The only difference between the two being that with Hantush, the water
 would not only come from storage from the aquifer itself, but also from
 leakage through an overlying (and or an underlying) aquitard in proportion
 to the drawdown caused by the well.
 This solution also largely extended the possible cases that were amenable
 to analyses.
 Contrary to the Theis-solution, the Hantush solution does approach a steady
 state within a limited time.
 Both solutions are mathematically similar, in fact, the Theis solution
 is a special case of the more general Hantush solution; the Theis solution
 is the Hantush solution for the case that the vertical hydraulic resistance
 of the aquitard 
\begin_inset Formula $c=\frac{d}{k'}$
\end_inset

 [T] (with 
\begin_inset Formula $d\,\mathrm{[L]}$
\end_inset

 the thickness of the aquitard and 
\begin_inset Formula $k'\,\mathrm{[L/T]}$
\end_inset

 its effective vertical conductivity) is infinite.
 Note that the dimension of 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 is [T], i.e.
 time.
 The flow and drawdown caused by extracting from a well in an infinite aquifer
 must be axially symmetric.
 figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:pde_axial_flow_to_well"
plural "false"

\end_inset

 shows the general situation in cross section.
 A well with a well radius 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{0}$
\end_inset

 is extracting a constant flow 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{0}\,\mathrm{[L^{3}/T]}$
\end_inset

.
 The aquifer is semi-confined; so there is exchange of water through the
 overlying aquitard with resistance 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 [T] with water on top of that layer with a constant water level 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 All water levels or heads are with respect to an arbitrary datum (reference
 elevation) as indicated.
 The leakage at any 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 equals 
\begin_inset Formula $n=\frac{h_{0}-h_{r,t}}{c}$
\end_inset

 [L/T].
 The head in the aquifer is denoted by the curved lines.
 During the time step 
\begin_inset Formula $dt$
\end_inset

 the head increases from 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{r,t}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{r,t+dt}=h_{r,t}+\frac{\partial h_{r,t}}{dt}dt$
\end_inset

.
 Please watch the signs.
 It is clear that when we extract water from the well, the heads will decline
 and the flows designated in the figure  are directed towards the well.
 However, they are drawn in the opposite direction, the direction in which
 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is positive and 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 is positive.
 This facilitates somewhat the derivation, it only has an effect on where
 we will have minus signs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The governing partial differential equation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We start the derivation using small discrete values for the distance difference
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta r$
\end_inset

 and the time step 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t$
\end_inset

, which later on will be reduced to the infinitesimal values 
\begin_inset Formula $dr$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $dt$
\end_inset

 respectively.
 Furthermore let 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 be the flow in the middle of our time step.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now consider the water budget for a ring between 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r+\Delta r$
\end_inset

 surrounding the well expressed in rates.
 The water budget in terms of rates for the ring then is as follows (using
 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 for the head):

\]

\end_inset

dividing by 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi r\Delta r$
\end_inset

 and by 
\begin_inset Formula $kD$
\end_inset

 yields
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\left(\frac{\partial h}{\partial r}\right)_{r+\Delta r}-\left(\frac{\partial h}{\partial r}\right)_{r}}{\Delta r}+\frac{1}{r}\left(\frac{\partial h}{\partial r}\right)_{r+\Delta r}=\frac{h-h_{0}}{kDc}+\frac{S}{kD}\frac{\partial h}{\partial t}
\]

\end_inset

Taking the limit for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta r\rightarrow dr$
\end_inset

 yields the partial differential equation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial^{2}h}{\partial r^{2}}+\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial h}{\partial r}=\frac{h-h_{0}}{kDc}+\frac{S}{kD}\frac{\partial h}{\partial t}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We may set 
\begin_inset Formula $s=h-h_{0},$
\end_inset

 showing that the solution depends on the difference between the head in
 the aquifer and that in the adjacent layer.
 Therefore, our final partial differential equation is in terms of the head
 difference with the constant head in the adjacent layer becomes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial^{2}s}{\partial r^{2}}+\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial s}{\partial r} & =\frac{s}{\lambda^{2}}+\frac{S}{kD}\frac{\partial s}{\partial t}\mbox{, with }\lambda=\sqrt{kDc}\label{eq:PDF-Hantush}
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This partial differential equation is valid for axial flow in a semi-confined
 aquifer, and therefore, also for the Hantush (leaky) situation.
 It should be immediately clear that for 
\begin_inset Formula $c\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 when the aquitard becomes impervious, turns into an aquiclude, the term
 
\begin_inset Formula $s/\lambda^{2}$
\end_inset

 drops out.
 This then yields the partial differential equation that is valid for the
 Theis situation.
 Hence, the Theis situation is a special case of the Hantush situation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It should further be clear from this derivation that the partial differential
 equation is a water budget on infinitesimal scale.
 The left-hand side tells us how much the net flow of water is that flows
 into one meter of the the ring (not out of the ring, because in the last
 but one equation above we changed the sign), while on the right-hand side
 of the equal sign we have the terms that quantify where this net inflow
 goes.
 The first term to the right gives the part that flows into storage, and
 the second term to the right quantifies the leakage lost to the adjacent
 layer.
 With the second term on the right-hand side zero in the case of the Theis
 situation, all net water flow into the ring goes into storage and, vice
 versa, all water extracted from the ring (i.e.
 from the aquifer) stems from storage and only from storage.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the derivation derived above, we considered a (semi-)confined aquifer,
 i.e.
 an aquifer filled to the top without a free water table.
 The storage coefficient, therefore is the elastic storage coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 [-], i.e.
 the specific storage coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{s}$
\end_inset

 [1/L] multiplied by the aquifer thickness 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 [L].
 If we substitute the specific yield 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{y}$
\end_inset

 [-], which is also dimensionless, for 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 [-] the partial differential equation is just as valid for a water table
 aquifer, under the sole condition that the thickness of the water-table
 aquifer may be regarded constant, just like the transmissivity in the case
 of a confined or semi-confined aquifer.
 Generally, for this assumption to be acceptable, the drawdown due to the
 well extraction must not be too large with respect to the thickness of
 the aquifer.
 A drawdown below 20% of the wetted thickness of a water-table aquifer usually
 is acceptable, especially when we apply the linearization explained in
 the previous section.

\begin_layout Subsection
The Theis and Hantush well functions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now with the governing partial differential equation in place, the art is
 to find closed analytical solutions for specific cases that are useful
 to us, for instance the flow towards wells.
 These solutions then must fulfill both the partial differential equation
 and the initial conditions and the boundary conditions.
 A useful solution of a well would be that for which the initial head or
 drawdown is zero, and as boundary conditions that the head at infinity
 will always remain zero, while the flow through a ring with infinitesimally
 small radius around the well equals the constant extraction from the well.
 This solution was found by

Notice that it is not the head that is important, only the difference from
 the initial head matters, which is the head change or the drawdown.
 Also notice that all steady-state well formulas have the factor 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi kD$
\end_inset

, while the transient solutions all have the factor 
\begin_inset Formula $4\pi kD$
\end_inset

 Finally notice that the well function

\end_inset

 does not depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 separately, but on a single variable, called 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

, which combines 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 together with 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 in a specific way.
 All formulas describing transient flow to wells have this variable

As just said, the function 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{W}\left(\right)$
\end_inset

 is known as Theis' well function among hydrologists.
 However, mathematicians new that function long before Theis; they have
 a name for it, namely the exponential integral, it can be expressed as
 an integral
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{W}\left(u\right)=\mbox{expint}\left(u\right)=\mbox{E}_{1}\left(u\right)=\intop_{u}^{\infty}\frac{e^{-y}}{y}dy\label{eq:Theis-expint-representation}

 Nowadays, this exponential integral function is readily available in software

The Hantush solution function is similar, it can be expressed as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s=h-h_{0}=\frac{Q}{4\pi kD}\mathtt{W}_{h}\left(u,\frac{r}{\lambda}\right)\mbox{, with }u=\frac{r^{2}S}{4kDt}\mbox{ and }\lambda=\sqrt{kDc}
\]

\end_inset

in which 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{W}_{h}\left(\right)$
\end_inset

 is called the Hantush well function, which now depends on both 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

.
 Mathematically, the Hantush well function is similar to to the Theis well
 function, it is written as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mbox{W}_{h}\left(u,\frac{r}{\lambda}\right)=\intop_{u}^{\infty}\frac{e^{-y-\frac{\left(\frac{r}{2\lambda}\right)^{2}}{y}}}{y}dy\label{eq:Hantush-well-function}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is immediately clear, that when 
\begin_inset Formula $c\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

, we get the Theis well function back.
 Hence, Theis is a special case of Hantush.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The conditions under which the drawdown formulas are valid are summarized
 as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The aquifer has uniform transmissivity and uniform storativity (either elastic
 storativity (or storage coefficient) when confined/semi-confined, or specific
 yield when phreatic).
 In case of a phreatic/unconfined/water-table aquifer, the drawdown should
 be small with respect to the aquifer thickness so that the transmissivity
 is not changed much.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The aquifer extends to infinity.
 In practice, this means that the aquifer extends far enough such that the
 drawdown is not affected by boundaries of the groundwater system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The well is pumped at a constant rate from a given point in time, which
 is set to

\end_inset

The non-steady drawdown distributed near a well discharging from an infinite
 leaky aquifer is presented.
 Variation of drawdown with time and distance caused by a well of constant
 discharge in confined sand of uniform thickness and uniform permeability
 is obtained.
 The discharge is supplied by the reduction of storage through expansion
 of the water and concomitant compression of the sand, and also by leakage
 through the confining bed.
 The leakage is assumed to be at a rate proportional to the drawdown at
 any point.
 Storage of water in the confining bed is neglected.

Implementation of the Theis and Hantush well function in Python
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Below we give an implementation of the Theis and Hantush well functions
 in Python.
 The Python implementation is powerful because one function call can handle
 millions of numbers at once.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Theis' well function (exponential integral)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the implementation in Python, we don't have to look far because the
 exponential integral is the function
\emph on
 exp1
\emph default
 that is present in the Python module
\emph on
 scipy.special.

\emph default
 So just import the function from the module
\emph on
 scipy.special
\emph default
 as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "language=Python,basicstyle={\small},breaklines=true"
inline false

\begin_layout Plain Layout

from scipy.special import exp1

\begin_layout Standard
A comparison with the table of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

 reveals that this is indeed the correct function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If one prefers to use the letter 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{W}\left(\cdots\right)$
\end_inset

 of this well function, we can import the function as follows
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "basicstyle={\small},breaklines=true"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

from scipy.special import exp1 as W
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can also implement the well function by carrying out the integration
 ourselves.
 We have to do this anyway to implement the Hantush well function, which
 is not already available in the python scientific package.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this implementation we need a function that yields the expression below
 the integral, which we call the kernel.
 Then we have to carry out the integration, which is conveniently done with
 the function
\emph on
 quad,
\emph default
which is present in the module
\emph on
 scipy.integrate.

\emph default
 Finally, we make sure that the obtained function can handle input arrays
 of arbitrary size and shape and not just scalars, which is what makes the
 implementation in Python really powerful.
 By putting these three steps in a function by its own, we have the numerical
 implementation conveniently packaged for general use.
\end_layout

\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{wh}\left(\cdots\right)$
\end_inset

 returns a

\emph default
 with two elements, of which the second reports the accuracy.
 We cut that part off by selecting only the first element by [0] in the
 last line.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You now have three ways to compute the Theis well function: 1) by directly
 calling
\emph on
 exp1
\emph default
 from Python module
\emph on
 scipy.special
\emph default
.
 2) by using the implementation of the Theis well function above and 3)
 by using 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{rho}=0$
\end_inset

 in the implementation of the Hantush well function as the Theis well function
 is a special case of the Hantush well function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Hantush well function can also be expressed as a power series.
 But this is beyond this current course.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Type-curves for the Theis and Hantush well functions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All books on groundwater pumping tests show type curves for the Theis and
 Hantush well function (figure  
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Theis-Hantush-type-curves"

\end_inset

).
 A type curve is a graph of the the well function plotted on double logarithmic
 scale in a way that makes it directly comparable with an actual drawdown
 curve versus time on double log axes.
 This is done by plotting 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{W}\left(u\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{W}_{h}\left(u,\frac{r}{\lambda}\right)$
\end_inset

 not versus 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 but versus 
\begin_inset Formula $1/u$
\end_inset

 on double log axes.
 The logic of doing this follows form 
\begin_inset Formula $1/u=\frac{4kDt}{r^{2}S}$
\end_inset

.
 The horizontal axis is then a constant times time, and so the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{W}\left(u\right)$
\end_inset

 versus 
\begin_inset Formula $1/u$
\end_inset

 graph then gives a picture of drawdown versus time, which is definitely
 the easiest way to remember it.
 For the Hantush situation, we will have multiple type curves, each for
 a specific value of 
\begin_inset Formula $r/\lambda$
\end_inset

.
 For small values of 
\begin_inset Formula $1/u$
\end_inset

 and, therefore of, small values of 
\begin_inset Formula $t/r^{2}$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 for small 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and large 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

, the Hantush well function behaves like the Theis well function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The type curves show that the Theis solution does not have a finite end-value;
 it keeps growing forever.
 Contrary to his, the Hantush curves all have a finite steady-state end-value,
 which depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho=\frac{r}{\lambda}$
\end_inset

.
 The higher the resistance of the aquitard, in fact the lower 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho=\frac{r}{\lambda}$
\end_inset

, the later will the equilibrium be reached, with 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho=0$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 the Theis curve, being the limiting case when no equilibrium will ever
 be attained.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Example application
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the past, these type curves have always been used to compute the drawdown.
 For instance say we want to compute the drawdown at 
\begin_inset Formula $r=250$
\end_inset

 m from the well after 
\begin_inset Formula $t=20$
\end_inset

 d of pumping at a rate of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q=1200$
\end_inset

 m
\begin_inset Formula $^{3}$
\end_inset

/d.
 The formula is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s=\frac{Q}{4\pi kD}\mbox{W}_{h}\left(u,\frac{r}{\lambda}\right),\,\,\,\,u=\frac{r^{2}S}{4kDt},\,\,\,\,\lambda=\sqrt{kDc}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $kD=600$
\end_inset

 m
\begin_inset Formula $^{2}$
\end_inset

/d, 
\begin_inset Formula $S=0.2$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $c=1200$
\end_inset

 d, we then have 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=\sqrt{600\times1200}=850$
\end_inset

 m and 
\begin_inset Formula $u=\frac{0.2}{4\times600}\frac{r^{2}}{t}=8.3\times10^{-5}\frac{r^{2}}{t}$
\end_inset

 then the drawdown at 
\begin_inset Formula $r=250$
\end_inset

 m after 20 days will follow from 
\begin_inset Formula $u=8.3\times10^{-5}\times\frac{250^{2}}{20}=0.259$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho=\frac{250}{850}=0.3$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Q/\left(4\pi kD\right)=1200/(4\pi600)=0.159$
\end_inset

, so that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
s & =0.159\times\mbox{W}_{h}\left(0.259,0.3\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The value of 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{h}$
\end_inset

 can now be read from the type curve for 
\begin_inset Formula $r/\lambda=0.3$
\end_inset

.
 But on the horizontal axes we have to use 
\begin_inset Formula $1/u=3.86$
\end_inset

, hence 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{h}\left(\frac{1}{u}=3.86,\frac{r}{\lambda}=0.3\right)\approx0.6$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, the drawdown at 250 m from the well 20 days after pumping started
 is 
\begin_inset Formula $s=0.159\times0.6=0.95$
\end_inset

 m.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As demonstrated, these are quite some steps, whereby instead of reading
 the function value from the type-curves, it may be looked up in tables
 presented in books like 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "KrusemanG1994"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Nowadays it is, of course, much easier to implement the functions in a
 program such as Python (or Excel) and use them.
 This allows to making graphs that involves many points at once and also
 to applying superposition easily, which by hand also requires many table
 look-ups.

Inflection points in the graphs of the Hantush well functions on half-logarithmi
c scales (well functions versus log of 
\begin_inset Formula $1/u$
\end_inset

)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We may further explore the behavior of these two well functions by showing
 them with a linear vertical scale and a logarithmic horizontal scale see
 figure  
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Theis-and-Hantush-curves-halflog-inflection-points"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Notice that the vertical axis is reversed (so the drawdown increases downward)
 to reflect real drawdown.
 This is not essential.
 On a half-log scale one sees that with the Theis curves, after some initial
 time, the drawdown starts increasing linearly with 
\begin_inset Formula $1/u$
\end_inset

 and, hence, also with time.
 Each Hantush type curve reaches a maximum value after some time.
 A characteristic of in these Hantush curves is their inflection point.
 Each inflection point marks the time at which the Hantush drawdown is exactly
 half its final equilibrium value.
 The inflection point is reached for 
\begin_inset Formula $u=\frac{\rho}{2}=\frac{r}{2\lambda}$
\end_inset

, so 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{W}_{h}\left(\frac{r}{2\lambda},\frac{r}{\lambda}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 This knowledge can be used to estimate at what time this inflection point
 is reached at a given distance.
 Mathematically we have
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
u=\frac{r^{2}S}{4kDt_{50\%}}=\frac{r}{2\lambda}
\]

\end_inset

and, therefore,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
t_{50\%}=\frac{rS\sqrt{kDc}}{2kD}=rS\sqrt{\frac{c}{kD}}\mbox{, with dimension }\left[\mathrm{\left[L\right]\left[-\right]\sqrt{\frac{\left[T\right]}{\left[L^{2}/T\right]}}}\right]=\mathrm{\left[T\right]}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dimension is indeed time.
 On the other hand, if you have a measured drawdown curve and you recognize
 with some accuracy the inflection point of the drawdown on linear scale
 versus 
\begin_inset Formula $1/u$
\end_inset

 on half-log scales, you may conclude that this point is half-way the final
 equilibrium value.
 Also, if your measured drawdown curve shown no sign of inflection towards
 the horizontal line, then you may conclude that the drawdown is still developin
g according to the Theis solution and that there is no influence up to that
 time visible of any leakage through an aquitard above below the aquifer.

\begin_inset Formula $-\ln u=9.4,\,6.9,\,4.6,\,2.3,\,0$

 The Theis type-curve on half-log axes already revealed that after some
 time the drawdown keeps increasing linearly with the log of time, i.e.
 with by a constant value for every log-cycle of time.
 But the approximation proves that this must indeed be the case.

Radius of influence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Theis well function plotted versus 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $t/r^{2}$
\end_inset

 clearly shows that it takes some time for the drawdown to reach a piezometer
 at a given distance.
 Therefore, we may speak of a
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

radius of influence
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which is dynamic, and indicates to how far from the well the drawdown
 is perceivable.
 It is often of practical importance.
 Clearly, we can define the radius of influence in different ways.
 For instance, we could say the radius of influence is the distance where
 the drawdown is 1 cm or, 10 cm or whatever seems appropriate.
 However, we could, and we do that here, opt for a more general definition.
 If we inspect the logarithmic approximation of the Theis well function,
 we see that at any given time, the drawdown is approximately a straight
 cone when plotted versus distance.
 Over time, the point of intersection of this straight cone with zero drawdown
 moves away from the well.
 It is natural to define the radius of influence to be the distance at which
 the straight drawdown line intersects the drawdown 
\begin_inset Formula $s=0$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the log-approximation of the Theis well function, the analysis is straightf
orward.
 Starting with the approximation we have
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{W}\left(u\right)\approx\ln\left(\frac{2.25kDt}{r^{2}S}\right)=0
\]

\end_inset

so that for this to be true, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\log$
\end_inset

 must be 1.
 So,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{2.25kDt}{r^{2}S}=1
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

It is the radius from the well at which the drawdown is still zero according
 to the approximate Theis well function.
 This radius is, therefore, proportional with 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{t}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is, obviously, also larger when the transmissivity is larger, causing
 the well's influence to spread faster; and it is smaller when the storage
 coefficient is larger, which reduces the spreading of influence of the
 well.
 This simple expression is very practical to estimate how far the influence
 of a well under the conditions envisioned by Theis reaches as a function
 of time.

Relation between the transient Theis drawdown and the well-known Thiem solution
 for the drawdown in the steady-state situation.
 Time to reaching steady state.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A steady-state situation will develop after some time when we have any fixed-hea
d boundary at some distance from the well.
 We can illustrate this using a negative mirror well at some distance 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 from our well, which is equivalent to a straight line with a fixed head
 half-way and perpendicular to the line between the well and its mirror
 well.
 Superposition of these two wells yields (using the log-simplification for
 the Theis solution here for mathematical convenience):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s=s_{1}+s_{2}=\frac{Q}{4\pi kD}\ln\left(\frac{2.25kDt}{r_{1}^{2}S}\right)-\frac{Q}{4\pi kD}\ln\left(\frac{2.25kDt}{r_{2}^{2}S}\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the drawdown in the well, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{1}=r_{w}$
\end_inset

, the well's radius, and 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{2}=R$
\end_inset

, hence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
s & =\frac{Q}{4\pi kD}\ln\left(\frac{R^{2}}{r_{w}^{2}}\right)\\
 & =\frac{Q}{2\pi kD}\ln\left(\frac{R}{r_{w}}\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So if there is a fixed-head boundary somewhere, which in this case we created
 by putting a mirror well with opposite sign at distance 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

, this is equivalent to a well at 
\begin_inset Formula $r=R/2$
\end_inset

 from a fully penetrating river.
 Adding a mirror well with opposite sign and the same absolute pumping rate,
 therefore, causes the drawdown to become constant after some time.
 This is true because the logarithmic approximation will always be valid
 after sufficiently long times.
 Also notice that the square under the logarithm leads to 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi kD$
\end_inset

 (steady) instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $4\pi kD$
\end_inset

 (transient) in the numerator of the factor in front of the logarithm.
 This is always the case in steady-state solutions for wells.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To determine after how much time the steady state is effectively reached
 is the same as determining after how much time the logarithmic simplification
 of the well function is valid over the distance 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

.
 We may say as shown in before in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Power-approximation-of-Theis-well-function"
plural "false"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 that this is the case when 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{t,R}<0.1$
\end_inset

.
 If we have for instance 
\begin_inset Formula $kD=600$
\end_inset

 m
\begin_inset Formula $^{2}$
\end_inset

/d and 
\begin_inset Formula $S=0.2$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $R=200$
\end_inset

 m, then the time at which the steady state may be set to be effectively
 reached could be be estimated from
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\frac{R^{2}S}{4kDt} & =0.1\\
t & =\frac{1}{0.4}\frac{R^{2}S}{kD}=\frac{100^{2}\times0.2}{0.4\times600}=8.3d
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, the choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $u=0.1$
\end_inset

 is arbitrary.
 Another also valid approach is through the argument at the steady state
 can only be reached after the
\emph on
radius of influence
\emph default
 has reached the mirror well.
 This approach gives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
R=\sqrt{\frac{2.25kD}{S}t}\rightarrow t_{ss}=\frac{R^{2}S}{2.25kD}=\frac{100^{2}\times0.2}{2.25\times600}=1.5d
\]

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Drawdown-vs-log-r-radius-of-influence"

\end_inset

 it may be concluded that the time to reach steady state is, in fact, longer
 than the time for the radius of influence to reach the mirror well, about
 3 times as much seems a better value, which then yields 4.5 days.
 The best way would be to look at the Theis drawdown on linear scale versus
 1/u on log-scale (see figure  
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Theis-and-Hantush-curves-halflog-inflection-points"

) to find that the drawdown on this graph as become straight at 
\begin_inset Formula $1/u\approx10$
\end_inset

 which is the same as 
\begin_inset Formula $u\approx0.1$
\end_inset

, which is the same as our first estimate in this section and, therefore
 yields the best estimate for reaching the steady-state situation in this
 case.
 In conclusion, because the transition from transient to steady state is
 continuous, there is not exact point at which the steady state can be said
 to commence, but it is well possible to give a useful, well informed, quantitat
ive estimate.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Theis situation

\begin_layout Standard
How much water is released from storage between two distances 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{2}$
\end_inset

? How much is the flow toward the well at distance 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

? For such type of questions we need the flow in the aquifer at distance
 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

.
 For the Theis situation, we can determine this flow analytically, by taking
 the derivative of the drawdown with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

.
 The derivation goes as follows
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s=\frac{Q_{0}}{4\pi kD}\mathtt{\mbox{W}}\left(u\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
Q_{r} & = & -2\pi rkD\frac{\partial s}{\partial r}\\
Q_{r} & = & -\left(2\pi rkD\right)\frac{\partial\left(\frac{Q_{0}}{4\pi kD}\mbox{W}\left(u\right)\right)}{\partial r}\\
 & = & -\frac{2\pi krD}{4\pi kD}Q_{0}\frac{d\mbox{W}\left(u\right)}{du}\frac{\partial u}{\partial r}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

so that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{Q_{r}}{Q_{0}}=-\frac{r}{2}\frac{d\mbox{W}\left(u\right)}{du}\frac{\partial u}{\partial r}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With 
\begin_inset Formula $u=r^{2}S/\left(4kDt\right)$
\end_inset

 it follows that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial u}{\partial r}=\frac{2rS}{4kDt}=\frac{2}{r}\frac{r^{2}S}{4kDt}=\frac{2u}{r}
\]

\end_inset

hence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{Q_{r}}{Q_{0}} & = & -u\frac{d\mbox{W}\left(u\right)}{du}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using the mathematical expression for the well function, we have
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{Q_{r}}{Q_{0}} & = & -u\frac{d}{du}\left(\intop_{u}^{\infty}\frac{e^{-y}}{y}dy\right)\\
 & = & +u\frac{e^{-u}}{u}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, finally, we obtain the simple analytical expression
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{Q_{r}}{Q_{0}} & = & e^{-u}\label{eq:Q-as-function-of-r-1}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

or
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{Q_{r}}{Q_{0}}=\exp\left(-\frac{r^{2}S}{4kDt}\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a very simple relationship between the flow 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{r}$
\end_inset

 at distance 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 and time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and the constant extraction 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{0}$
\end_inset

 from the well.
 Because 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 is proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $r^{2}$
\end_inset

, this ratio diminishes exponentially with the distance from the well.
 This means that the water comes from storage for say 99% within a given
 radius from the well.
 This radius is extending dynamically.
 Because 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 is proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $1/t$
\end_inset

, it means that the ratio goes to 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 within increasing time over any distance 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

.
 This implies that the flow becomes essentially steady, i.e.
 reaches for instance 99% of the total extraction rate within a given radius
 after a certain time.
 Within that radius, the discharge towards the well is essentially equal
 to the extraction from the well.
 Hence, over time, the water comes from the storage further and further
 from the well and the contribution from the zone closer to the well declines
 to zero over time.
 Although the drawdown will never become steady state in the Theis situation,
 the discharge at any fixed distance from the well does become essentially
 steady state (will approach the well extraction more and more over time).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A constant discharge equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{0}$
\end_inset

 within a certain distance implies that the gradients will also become constant
 within the same distance.
 This in turn implies that the difference between the drawdowns in observation
 wells will also become constant and equal to the differences between the
 heads in these piezometers in the steady-state case, although this steady-state
 case is never reached.
 This implies that for sufficiently large times, we can then interpret the
 transient pumping test like we interpret a steady-state one, but based
 on the head differences between observation wells.
 Clearly, this requires the presence of sufficient observation.
 And, of course, one cannot obtain a storage coefficient from a steady-state
 analyses.

 emphasize the delay occurring with distance from the well (but realize
 that the time axis is logarithmic).
 All graphs look the same, except for the delay.
 Also, notice that once the drawdown becomes a straight line versus log
 time, the gradients with respect to distance will be constant.
 This implies that by then, the ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{r}/Q_{0}$
\end_inset

 should have asymptotically approached the value of 1.
 This is easily verified by laying a ruler along the declining branches
 of the darwdown curves (top chart) and verify from what point in time these
 curves have become straight lines, and compare this with the extent by
 which the graph of

Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
A very important usage of the Theis and Hantush well function is the determinati
on of the aquifer parameters from the drawdowns determined in a pumping
 test.
 This section shows such analyses for both the Theis and the Hantush case
 using artificial data with added noise.
 The artificial data allow a close comparison between the two situations.
 The approximate Theis solution (logarithmic) from allows exploiting the
 behavior of the drawdown on linear scale as a function of the log time
 and log 
\begin_inset Formula $t/r^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 It allows to always compute the transmissivity of the aquifer accurately
 wherever this drawdown is clearly linear.
 This is also valid for the Hantush case, because the Hantush drawdown initially
 follows the Theis drawdown often yielding a nice straight line for early
 times in well close to the well or from water level measurements inside
 the well itself.

We will first analyze the pumping test in the Theis situation using the
 simplified logarithmic well function and then proceed with the classical
 pumping test analyses on double logarithmic axes.
 That analysis works the same for the Theis and the Hantush situation.
 The classic Hantush analysis suffers from the noise in the data.
 However we overcome this by taking advantage of the mentioned straightforward
 determination of the transmissivity first, allowing a much better end result.

 helps enormously with the interpretation of the measured transient drawdowns.
 We just have to put the drawdown in a graph with the drawdown vertically
 on a linear axis and the time horizontally on a logarithmic axis.
 The drawdown in the Theis situation then manifests itself by a linear increase
 with the log of time.
 The formula for the Theis drawdown is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

Knowing the well extraction 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 and reading the increase of the drawdown over one log-cycle form the drawdown
 graph over a portion of the curve where it declines linearly versus log
 time, then uniquely yields the transmissivity of the aquifer.
 Hence, it does not matter where the drawdown is measured, in the well itself
 or in an observation well, as long as we get a linear drawdown per log-cycle,
 we will thus obtain the aquifer transmissivty.
 Well clogging, partial penetration (see section

) and any other objections simply play no role here; we only need the drawdown
 increase per log-cycle where the drawdown increases linearly with log time.
 This is the simplest an probably the most robust way to determine an aquifer's
 transmissivity.
 And it hold both for the Theis and the Hantush situation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To what extent is it now also possible to determine the storage coefficient
 of the aquifer?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In theory it looks easy, but in practice there are complications.
 Let's do the theory first and, by the previous analysis we now already
 know the transmissivity.
 Given the approximation of the Theis well function, when will the drawdown
 be zero? The answer is simple, as it is the argument of the logarithm that
 then must be 1.
 So we have zero drawdown when
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s=0\rightarrow\frac{2.25kD}{S}\frac{t_{0}}{r^{2}}=1

Therefore,

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find the time 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{0}$
\end_inset

 by extending the straight portion of the drawdown to where it intersects
 the horizontal line 
\begin_inset Formula $s=0$
\end_inset

.
 Now with 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{0}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $kD$
\end_inset

 and the distance to the well 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 known, we obtain the storage coefficient from the last expression.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But there are some complications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
When the well screen only partially penetrates the aquifer, the drawdown
 in piezometers less than about 1.5 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 from the pumping well may suffer from additional drawdown due to the contractio
n of stream lines near the screen.
 This effect may even be negative for piezometer screens near the well but
 well below or above the well screen.
 The extra drawdown is especially present inside the pumping well if its
 screen only partially penetrates the aquifer.
 Therefore, where partial penetration plays a role, the measured drawdown
 does not reflect the theoretical drawdown that we based our formula on
 (i.e.
 the fully penetrating case).
 And so, simply reading the time where the darwdown line intersects 
\begin_inset Formula $s=0$
\end_inset

 would not reflect the right value.
 This can be corrected somewhat by taking partial penetration into account,
 but only to a limited amount because of unknown vertical conductivity which
 likely differs from the horizontal one and will vary likely also with depth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The second complication is that we will not get the correct value if we
 measure only in the pumping well.
 Even though we know its radius and even if we know that its screen is fully
 penetrating the aquifer, the screen may be clogged to some extent.
 We have no way to estimate this by only measuring the declining head in
 the well.
 Therefore, we cannot reasonably expect to obtain a correct value for the
 time 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{0}$
\end_inset

 this way.
 To circumvent complications by clogging of the screen of the pumping well,
 we must use separate observation wells of which the drawdown is not impacted
 by potential clogging of their screen nor by partial penetration of the
 well screen.
 Therefore, these observation wells should preferably be at least 1.5D away
 from the well.
 It is, of course, best to have several observation wells, so that one can
 verify to what extent each of them yields the same result for 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In conclusion, use of the logarithmic approximation of the Theis well function
 is robust and effective to uniquely determine the transmissivity of the
 aquifer, provided the linear drawdown versus log time increases linearly.
 However, its use to also determine the storage coefficient is limited in
 practice due to the fact that at small distances from a partially penetrating
 well screens the obtained drawdown diverts from the theoretical one.
 Moreover, inside the pumping well we have an unknown extra drawdown due
 to its clogging, which makes invalidates the drawdown measured in the well
 for determination of the storage coefficient even if it were fully penetrating
 the aquifer.
 It is best to have more than one separate observation wells at sufficient
 distance from the pumping well, but in that case we can just as well use
 other analysis methods.

 The data are shown with the drawdown increasing downward.
 The second chart in the same figure  shows the same data versus the log

 All lines then become straight, declining lines (increasing drawdown) after
 some initial time, depending on the distance of the piezometer to the well.
 When this happens, one is sure that the situation that the situation complies
 with the one that Theis had in mind.
 As is seen from the lines, all lines finally have the same increase of
 drawdown per log-cycle.
 Hence, it does not matter which piezometer or even the water level in the
 well itself is used to determine the transmissivity.
 The drawdown per log-cycle is here about 0.49 m as shown by the yellow lines

 The difference between the first and the rest may be due to the accuracy
 with which the

 It could also result from heterogeneity in the aquifer.
 However, in this case, a much more important cause will be partial penetration
 of the well screen due to which the drawdown in piezometers closer than
 about 1.5D from the well differ from the theoretical value that is valid
 for a fully penetrating well screen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most direct way to verify this is by not plotting the drawdown versus
 
\begin_inset Formula $\log(t)$
\end_inset

 but rather versus 
\begin_inset Formula $\log(t/r^{2})$
\end_inset

 because this is what the drawdown really depends on.
 Therefore, plotting the linear drawdown versus 
\begin_inset Formula $\log(t/r^{2})$
\end_inset

 should force all the drawdown curves to fall on a single one, unless other
 factors matter, such as partial penetration.

.
 All the curves for the piezometers that are farther then 60 m away from
 the well now fall on top of each other.
 Due to partial penetration, this is not the case for the drawdowns of piezomete
rs that are nearer to the well.
 The piezometers close to the well (with their screen at 50 m elevation)
 have a higher than expected drawdown due to concentration of stream lines.
 The piezometers at the same distance with the screen far below the well
 face (with screen at 10 m elevation) have a lower than expected drawdown,
 because the streamlines in this region of the aquifer divert instead of
 concentrate (see

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effect of partial penetration is most extreme at the well face.
 Moreover, the water level in the well itself usually has an extra drawdown
 even above the effect of partial penetration, which is due to combined
 clogging of the borehole face and the well face.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the position of the well screen and the aquifer thickness are known (and
 also the vertical anisotropy of the aquifer) then is it possible to take
 partial penetration into account, but this does not work for the drawdown
 determined in the well itself, because of potential clogging, which requires
 extra independent information to determine.

 (middle chart) but now for a semi-confined situation instead of a confined
 situation, hence we have an Hantush case instead of a Theis case.
 Also, the same orange dashed lines are plotted that were before used to
 determine the drawdown per log-cycle in figure  
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Pumping-test-data"
plural "false"

\end_inset

.
 The first thing we see is that now the drawdown will go towards a constant
 equilibrium value.
 The blue, red and green lines still yield a correct straight portion that
 allows computing the drawdown per log-cycle, but the black (
\begin_inset Formula $r=60$
\end_inset

 m), purple (
\begin_inset Formula $r=120$
\end_inset

 m) and cyan (
\begin_inset Formula $r=240$
\end_inset

 m) lines do not.
 This implies that the trick to determine the transmissivity from the straight
 increase of the drawdown, i.e.
 the portion of the drawdown for which the system still behaves like a Theis
 case, will work, but only for piezometers very close to the well and the
 well itself.
 But for larger distances, the previous method fails in the Hantush case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We've seen another property of the Hantush drawdown before, which is the
 inflection point.
 If the duration of the pumping test is sufficiently long, so that one can
 clearly estimate the inflection point, it could be exploited.
 At the inflection point we have
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
u & =\frac{r^{2}S}{4kDt}=\frac{r}{2\lambda}\\
\frac{S}{2}\sqrt{\frac{c}{kD}} & =\frac{t}{r}
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although for each inflection point we know 
\begin_inset Formula $t/r$
\end_inset

, and because we can determine the transmissivity from the drawdown per
 log-cycle, we are still left with two unknowns in this equation.
 Therefore, we need a better and more robust interpretation of the pumping
 test.
 This is the classical method, which uses the drawdown versus 
\begin_inset Formula $t/r^{2}$

 on double-logarithmic scales.

 We expect that all lines over the portion that the drawdown still behaves
 according to the Theis case would fall on one single line, while at later
 times the lines will deviate from the Theis curve as they approach the
 Hantush equilibrium.
 The graph shows that this only works for piezometers further away from
 the well, here for those least 60 m from the well.
 This is clear from the curves, which show that at distances larger than
 60 m the drawdown in the to and the bottom of the aquifer are the same
 (See lines with the same color in the charts).
 The reason is, of course, the impact of partial penetration on the drawdown.
 Due to partial penetration, the piezometers at 50 m above the base of the
 aquifer, opposite the well face (at 40-60 m) over-estimate the drawdown.
 On the other hand, the piezometers at 10 m above the bottom of the aquifer,
 i.e.
 far below the bottom of the well, under-estimate the drawdown.
 The closer to the well, the more extreme this over- en underestimation
 is.
 The drawdown in the well itself (almost 10 m!) is further increased by
 clogging.
 For our interpretation we have to leave these piezometers out.
 Therefore we'll limit our analysis to the piezometers at 60, 120 and 240
 m from the well.

 the as yet unknown value of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q/\left(4\pi kD\right)$
\end_inset

, and multiplying by a constant is done by shifting by a constant on log-scale.
 Further, because 
\begin_inset Formula $1/u=\frac{4kD}{S}\times\frac{t}{r^{2}}$
\end_inset

, the horizontal axis of the graph of the measurements and that of the type-curv
es also differ by a factor (the as yet unknown value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{4kD}{S}$
\end_inset

.
 On log-scale this implies a horizontal shift of the two axes relative to
 each other.
 But in any case, the shape of the measurement curves should be exactly
 that of the type curves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, when we have the measurements and the type curves on two separate
 sheets of paper such that the size of each log-cycle both horizontally
 and vertically are the same in both graphics, then we can overlay them
 and shift them with respect to each other such that the measurements and
 the type-curves match as well as possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once we have this, we choose an arbitrary point (just prick a pin at that
 point through both sheets of paper) and call it the match point (I chose
 the big dot in figure

).
 Then read the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t/r^{2}$
\end_inset

 for the match point from the measurement sheet.
 This yields 
\begin_inset Formula $t/r^{2}=1.37\times10^{-5}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s=0.137$
\end_inset

.
 Next, read the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $Wh$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1/u$
\end_inset

 for the match point from the sheet with the type-curves.
 This yields 
\begin_inset Formula $1/u=100$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{Wh}=1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With these data compute the transmissivity and the storage coefficient.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First we focus on the vertical axes of the two charts using the values of
 the match point, for which we obtain:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}

0.137 & =\frac{2400}{2\pi kD}1\\

\end{align*}

\end_inset

Next, we focus on the horizontal axis, for which we have:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{u} & =4\frac{kD}{S}\frac{t}{r^{2}}\\

\frac{kD}{S} & =3.64\times10^{6}\\

The resistance of the aquitard then follows from which line of the Hantush

\end_inset

 and for 
\begin_inset Formula $r=240$
\end_inset

 m it is 
\begin_inset Formula $r/\lambda=0.5$
\end_inset

 Hence, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$

\begin_inset Formula $60/0.2=300$
\end_inset

 m, 
\begin_inset Formula $120/0.3$
\end_inset

 = 400 m and 
\begin_inset Formula $240/0.5$
\end_inset

=480 m.
 So it must be around 400 m.
 The aquitard resistance then becomes 
\begin_inset Formula $c=\lambda^{2}/kD=400^{2}/2800=60$
\end_inset

 d.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the classical pumping test analysis.
 It works the same for Theis and Hantush.
 However, for Hantush we will also find the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $r/\lambda$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

, which in turn yields the resistance of the aquitard when we have already
 determined the transmissivity of the aquifer.

Can we improve the accuracy?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yet in this case, the interpretation does not seem to be very accurate as
 the three 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 values are not very consistent.
 This is a consequence of the noise in the data.
 Can we do better? Remember that we may always determine the transmissivity
 from the drawdown per log-cycle, which is independent of partial penetration.
 We only need drawdown that has a sufficiently long straight portion on
 half-log scale.
 It is likely that the drawdowns close to the well and that inside the well
 itself will exhibit such an opportunity.

 This final chart allows us to select the best values for

 We thus find

\begin_layout Standard
In conclusion, we have interpreted the pumping test in a classical fashion,
 making use of the fact that the type curves and the measurements must have
 the exact same form on double log axes, under the conditions that there
 is no effect of partial penetration.
 We have experienced that the results may be less exact due to the presence
 of noise in the data resulting from phenomena like weather and barometer
 pressure fluctuations that have nothing to do with our pumping test, but
 can not be avoided in practice when pumping tests last for several days
 or weeks.
 Despite the difficulties resulting from this noise, we were able to take
 advantage of the universal fact that the transmissivity can be obtained
 uniquely and accurately from the straight portion of the drawdown when
 plotted versus the log 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, irrespective of partial penetration or even clogging of the well in case
 we measure the water level inside the well.
 This is also due to the fact that even in a semi-confined Hantush situation,
 the observation points close to the well still show a consistent Theis
 behavior at early times, allowing to extract a straight portion of the
 drawdown curves versus log 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 .
 With the transmissivity thus known accurately, we know the vertical shift
 of the measurement chart relative to the chart with the type curves, so
 that the charts only have to be shifted horizontally to find the best fit.
 This particular exercise was done in the computer, by plotting the Theis
 drawdown curves for a range of storage coefficients directly on the measurement
 chart, which allowed us to pick the one that best fits the data.
 With then both the transmissivity and the storage coefficient fixed, we
 could overlap the measurements with a bundle of Hantush computed drawdowns,
 for a range of values for 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho=\frac{r}{\lambda}$
\end_inset

.
 This allowed us to pick the best fitting 
\begin_inset Formula $r/\lambda$
\end_inset

 for the measurements of the piezometers at different larger distances from
 the well.
 As a result, we obtained an 
\begin_inset Formula $r/\lambda$
\end_inset

 value for each of the three piezometer distances, which in turn yielded
 three mutually consistent values for 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

.
 The average of these, combined with the transmissivty finally gave us the
 hydraulic resistance 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 of the aquitard.
 The final results are accurate and fully consistent with the data.

Groundwater is extracted from an unconfined aquifer to irrigate crops by
 means of a pivot, i.e.
 a well connected to an irrigation frame that slowly turn around the well.
 This pivot irrigates a disc of a surface are of 50 ha.
 50% of the irrigated waters is consumed by the crop and hence evaporated
 by it; the remaining 50% is water that returns to the aquifer.
 A crop consumes a water volume equivalent to a layer of 75 cm over the
 area served.
 Two crops can be harvested each year.
 What is the required pumping capacity of the well and how will the groundwater
 head below the pivot develop? To answer this question, compute the drawdown
 over time at the following distances from the well a) 0.2 m (=inside the
 well, required to see if the well could fall dry in the near future), b)
 at the edge of the irrigated 50ha circular area served by the well, c)
 at 2 and 5 times this radius to estimate its impact on neighboring wells.

).
 The water to the aquifer is rainwater that was captured in the nearby hills
 and mountains.
 The general groundwater flow away from the foot of the mountains causes
 a gradient of the natural groundwater, which is exploited by the drainage
 tunnels.
 These tunnels run from their downstream outlet in the villages with a small
 upward gradient towards the foot of the mountains, where they intersect
 the water table, so that groundwater will drain and flow towards the village
 through these tunnels.
 Assume that the average drawdown caused by these tunnels is 2 m.
 A developer intends develop a farm to grow crops in a new area nearby and
 wants to install wells for irrigation.
 The area to be irrigated is 50 ha and the required net consumption is 0.75
 m/year, hence a required year-average extraction of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.75\times50000/365=1030\mathrm{m^{3}/y}$

Som thoughts about the problem stated above.
 It may not seem immediately obvious to provide an answer with the simple
 tools of this course.
 But we can give it a try.
 We can compute the transient drawdown by the new well compute its effect
 near the foot of the mountains.
 With this, we can compute the drawdown everywhere, and therefore, also
 at every point of the qanats where they tap the groundwater, which is in
 the qanat drainage area.
 We may assume that the yield of the qanats is proportional to the drawdown
 they cause, which was 2 m.
 When we subtract the drawdown of the new well at the khettaras from that
 of the khettaras themselves, we have at least an estimate of the impact.
 A difficulty arises only from the integration of the drawdown impact along
 each khettara.
 However, we can just take the drawdown that the center of their tapping
 length as an approximation.

Superposition in time

We will illustrate superposition in time for the Theis situation, however,
 it works exactly the same for the Hantush case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A well may be switched on and off at will.
 The effect of this switching can be taken into account by superposition.
 For instance, a well that has been pumping for a time 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t_{i}$
\end_inset

 since 
\begin_inset Formula $t=0$
\end_inset

, after which it is switched off, can be viewed as two wells that pump continuou
sly.
 The first starts at 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{0}=0$
\end_inset

 with extraction 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{0}$
\end_inset

 and the second at 
\begin_inset Formula $t=t_{0}+\Delta t_{i}$
\end_inset

 with extraction 
\begin_inset Formula $-Q_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 This way, the net extraction will be zero for 
\begin_inset Formula $t>t_{0}+\Delta t$
\end_inset

.
 This superposition can be applied with a large number of changes of the
 flow rate at arbitrary times.
 The problem may only be that after many such changes one needs to carry
 on a large number of
\begin_inset Quotes eld

wells
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 at the location of the real well to compute the current state.
 This is merely a computational burden, one that can be effectively dealt
 with through application of convolution, explained elsewhere in this syllabus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

To deal with a well with varying extraction, we subdivide time in episodes
 during which the extraction from the well may be considered sufficiently
 constant.
 In this superposition we start a new well at the same position each time
 the flow rate changes.
 We let this new well extract the difference between the new rate and that
 of the previous well.

Of course, it is rather straightforward to carry out superposition with
 many well simultaneously, where each of them has a flow rate that varies
 independently of the other wells, and compute the resulting varying head
 or drawdown at an arbitrary location.
 And if we do this for many location simultaneously, we can show the the
 head contours in an entire region fluctuating under the influence of many
 wells of which each extracts at it's own will.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Superposition in space
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The contributions of an arbitrary number of pumping wells can be added together,
 because the underlying partial differential equation is linear.
 Therefore, superposition works in space as well as in time.
 One can have an arbitrary number of wells that are pumping arbitrary amounts
 of water, and compute the drawdown at any number of arbitrary points simultaneo
usly by superposition of the ensemble of wells, while per well the superposition
 in time is done as explained in the previous section.
 Because superposition is valid, the drawdown can be superimposed on the
 ambient groundwater head to get the real head in the aquifer.

 It is practical in this case, to work in years and convert the transmissivity

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the spatial snapshot we compute the drawdowns in a dense-enough spacial
 grid to allow contouring of the drawdown at a specific point in time.
 The grid used is 10 m spacing between -1000 and +1000 m for both the 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and the 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 axis.
 With these coordinates, the distance is computed to each of the wells.
 The distance from the grid points to one well is already 160000 points
 (this requires Python, Excel can't hardy handle this).
 To prevent division by zero make sure the the minimum distance is 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{w}$
\end_inset

, the well radius.
 Zero distance occurs of a grid point happens to coincided with the position
 of a well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, for each of the four required snapshot times, add the contribution
 of each of the four wells and for each well use the time since the extraction
 from that well started.
 The last step is to contour the results as presented in figure  
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 The figure  uses the same contour lines in all four snapshots, but the
 values are not indicated in the figure .
 This, could, however, been done by using full colors and placing a color
 bar next to each figure .
 Each snapshot is taken 0.5 years after the previous well started.

 Imagine the enterprise's premises to be 2 km wide having 500 ha of cropped

Partial penetration of well screens
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More often than not, well screens only partially penetrate the exploited
 aquifer because aquifers may be much thicker than the screen length that
 is needed to produce the required amount of water.
 Limiting well depth saves money for the owner, although at the cost of
 some extra pumping energy, because of the extra head loss due to the fact
 that the streamlines of the water flowing towards the well have to concentrate
 near the screen, which causes it to accelerate, and higher velocities entail
 greater losses of energy.

 is a summary for the effect of partial penetration in the well only.
 To also obtain the impact of partial penetration for points outside the
 well, we need a more general analytical solution.
 The extra drawdown due to partial penetration can be computed from the
 analytical solution for the extra drawdown due to partial penetration given
 by Hantush.

The variables are shown in figure

 Notice that the distance can be either measured from the top or from the
 bottom of the aquifer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This equation allows to compute the extra drawdown due to partial penetration
 at any point in the aquifer as specified by the coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, to estimate this extra drawdown for the well itself, one should
 choose some points at distance 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{0}$
\end_inset

, the well radius, and average over them, because, contrary to a real well
 screen that has a constant head inside, the derivation of the influence
 of partial penetration was under the assumption of a constant discharge
 per unit screen length.
 The latter causes some variation of head along the screen, while a uniform
 head causes some variation of the inflow along the screen.
 But the errors are not great.

 is a a steady-state solution, which cannot account for dynamics.
 However, the effect of water released from storage close to the well due
 to the partial penetration alone is essentially elastic.
 The fully penetration solution takes care of the slow storage release in
 case of a water table aquifer with a large storage coefficient, i.e.
 a specific yield 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore the effect of partial penetration along becomes steady-state
 already after a very short time.
 One could estimate this time as the time it takes for gradients become
 stable within the reach in the aquifer where of the partial-penetration
 effect matters.
 To determine that time, we can use the derived relation for the flow

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After having implemented equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:partial-penetration-analytical"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 in Python, we can compute the effect of partial penetration for any point
 in the aquifer and add it to the drawdown for the fully penetrating well.
 This was done.
 figure  
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Head-contours-PP-screen"

\end_inset

 shows the head contours due to a partially penetrating screen between 
\begin_inset Formula $30\le z\le40$
\end_inset

 m placed in an aquifer where 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le z\le50$
\end_inset

 m.
 The actual situation, shown in the bottom picture, is the superposition
 of the heads due to a fully penetrating well, shown in the top picture,
 and the effect of partial penetration, shown in the middle picture.
 The streamlines (not plotted) are perpendicular to the head contours and
 show the contraction of the flow near the screen, especially near the ends
 of the screen.
 The bottom picture in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Head-contours-PP-screen"

\end_inset

 was obtained by adding equation  
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:partial-penetration-analytical"

\end_inset

 to a simple Dupuit solution 
\begin_inset Formula $s=Q/\left(2\pi kD\right)\ln\left(R/r\right)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $R=100$
\end_inset

 was chosen.
 The contribution of the head due to partial penetration has a positive
 zone in front of the screen, where the drawdown is increased and negative
 zones above and below the screen, where the drawdown is reduced by partial
 penetration, but where the flow is much smaller than directly opposite
 the screen.
 As can be seen from the pictures, the effect of the partial penetration
 does not reach farther than about one aquifer thickness from the well (in
 this vertically isotropic aquifer).
 So the 1.5D mentioned above for the practical reach of the impact of partial
 penetration is good for most practical situations, unless the aquifer is
 very anisotropic in the vertical sense.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In conclusion, for such a detailed picture and computation of the head around
 a well screen we don't need a large 3D numerical model at all.
 And, if you have such a model, you can use the analytical approach to verify
 that you haven't made mistakes in this big model.

Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
Pumping-tests drawdowns do not always resemble the Theis or Hantush type
 curves; sometimes the drawdown shows a double dip, which is known as delayed
 yield.
 Because delayed yield is quite ubiquitous, it has been studied extensively
 by scholars in the past, most noticeably by

 While 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 introduced an extra delay parameter to explain the phenomenon,

\end_inset

 demonstrated for a large number of pumping tests in his home state in the
 USA that the Boulton solution well matched the curves obtained from real-world
 tests.
 However, there was no direct physical mechanism behind Boulton's delay
 parameter.
 It remains, therefore, unclear what its precise origin was.
 It was often assumed that it had to be the unsaturated zone, which is not
 accounted for in the known groundwater flow solutions.
 And, indeed, early groundwater-flow models, that accounted for saturated
 and unsaturated flow simultaneously were able to match the curves that
 had been measured by

 (see also

 However, it was 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "NeumanS1974"

, who solved the problem by showing that the delayed yield could be completely
 described by the combination of elastic storage, which operates throughout
 the aquifer, and and storage from the decline of the water table, which
 is generally accounted for by specific yield.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "NeumanS1974,NeumanS1975"

\end_inset

 derived an analytical solution for the flow to a well in a water-table
 aquifer, while taking into account vertical flow components.
 He showed that the released water initially stems from elastic storage,
 due to the expansion of the water and the compaction of the soil skeleton,
 which is a fast process due to the low value of this storage.
 He further showed that very soon after the start of the pump, the water
 table starts declining, which releases much more water by emptying pores
 near the water table, which, therefore is a slow process.
 It means that after some time, the release of pore water at the water table
 becomes the dominant process.
 The result in drawdown line is a graph that resembles two Theis curves,
 an early Theis curve in accordance with the elastic storage, and a late
 Theis curve, in accordance with specific-yield storage.

\begin_layout Subsection
Water-table aquifer

\begin_layout Standard
We may show the phenomena on the hand of some numerical simulations as shown
 in figure  
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Delayed-yield-three-graphs"

\end_inset

.
 The first picture shows the drawdown versus time for a number of points
 at different distances from the well and for different depths as expressed
 in % of the aquifer thickness.
 The colors correspond to three depths.
 The blue curves are near the top of the aquifer, the magenta curves in
 the center of the aquifer, and the green curves near the bottom.
 As the figure  indicates, the drawdowon differs with depth, but only for
 piezometers that are not far from the well; at later times this difference
 disappears.
 The second picture in the same figure  shows the depth-averaged drawdown
 for a number of distances from the well.
 The later curves correspond to larger differences.
 One sees that the curves initially correspond to the Theis drawdown computed
 for the elastic storage coefficient, while later on they match the drawdown
 that corresponds to the Theis solution for the specific yield.
 The shorter the distance to the well, the more pronounced the transition
 between the two Theis curves is.
 Obviously, the curves that correspond to the larger distances are later.
 The effect of depth has been eliminated from the second chart by taking
 the average head over the full depth of the aquifer at each distance.
 The third picture in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Delayed-yield-three-graphs"

\end_inset

 demonstrates the difference of the drawdown at different depths at the
 same location, which was chosen at 
\begin_inset Formula $r=28.4$

 m from the well.
 From these graphs, it becomes especially manifest that the closer to the
 water table, the later the drawdown graph.

 were computed using a numerical axially-symmetric model with elastic storage
 everywhere, but only specific yield at the water table.
 There is no unsaturated zone in the model.
 This is in accordance with Neuman (1972) who explained that the phenomenon
 of delayed yield can be fully explained by the simultaneous action of the
 elastic storage in the whole aquifer and the specific yield at the water
 table.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Generalization to semi-confined aquifers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We may now generalize delayed yield, by extending it to any groundwater
 system in which a water table will decline in a reaction to pumping.
 This especially holds true for semi-confined aquifers.
 The Hanush assumptions underlying his solution include a fixed head in
 the overlying layer.
 When in reality this head cannot be maintained, it will cause a delayed-yield
 effect.
 This may be the case in many practical situations without it being determined
 in a pumping test, because the pumping has stopped long before the delayed
 yield would become visual in the drawdown curves.
 The reason is the delay that is caused by the resistance against vertical
 flow from the overlying layer.
 That this is the case, is explained by the characteristic time for filling
 the semi-confined aquifer given an initial head difference with the overlying
 layer.
 This characteristic time, 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

, equals 
\begin_inset Formula $T=Sc$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is the elastic storage coefficient of the aquifer and 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 the resistance of the overlying layer against vertical flow.
 With typical values of say 
\begin_inset Formula $S=0.001$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c=500$
\end_inset

 d, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $T=0.5$
\end_inset

 d.
 This means that a sudden lowering of the head in the semi-confined aquifer
 would be fully compensated by increased leakage in about 
\begin_inset Formula $5T\approx2.5$
\end_inset

 d.
 This characteristic time affects only the level of the transition zone
 between the two Theis curves.
 We can show this by computing the drawdown in a semi-confined aquifer.
 For this we use an aquifer system consisting of a resistance cover layer
 that is 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{cover}=12$
\end_inset

 m thick on top of a 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{aquif}=35$
\end_inset

This figure  shows the drawdown averaged over the thickness of the aquifer
 for different distances from the well.
 We expect the first branch of the graphs to resemble Hanush's semi-confined
 drawdown, for which the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $r/\lambda$
\end_inset

 determines the elevation of their horizontal equilibrium branch.
 The spreading lengths of the four models are 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=[59,\,187,\,,591,\,1870]$
\end_inset

 m respectively.
 The lower the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $r/\lambda$
\end_inset

, the more the Hantush curve deviates from the Theis curve.
 This effect is clearly visible when the first picture is compared with
 the fourth.
 When the vertical resistance is high, the transfer to the late Theis curve
 is much delayed.
 One sees this in the fourth picture, where the graphs don't even reach
 the second Theis branch at the end of the simulation time, which was as
 large as 600 days! When the resistance is low, as in the first figure ,
 the graphs do show a clear transfer from the elastic Theis curve to the
 water-table Theis curve (first picture).
 The picture also shows that the drawdown for points near the well resemble
 the elastic Theis curve, while the points at large distances do not reveal
 any elastic behavior; they immediately follow the specific-yield Theis
 curve.
 The reason is that the first branch should follow Hantush which has an
 equilibrium 
\begin_inset Formula $Q/\left(2\pi kD\right)\mbox{K}_{0}\left(r/\lambda\right)$
\end_inset

, which approaches zero for large 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, points at larger 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

, say at 
\begin_inset Formula $r>3\lambda$
\end_inset

 will never see the elastic drawdown due to the leakage.
 The second branch, however, is a pure Theis curve, which has no equilibrium,
 because it has no recharge (all its water comes from water-table storage).
 Therefore, points far away from the well will eventually all feel the phreatic
 drawdown as predicted by Theis (if there are no head boundaries might prevent
 this).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To determine the resistance of the overlying layer, one should use the piezomete
rs that reach a Hantush-equilibrium and use the Hantush solution to interpret
 them.
 This also yields the elastic storage coefficient.
 If the test is sufficiently long, so that one or more piezometers reach
 the phreatich Theis branch, then also the specific yield of the overlying
 layer can be determined by applying the Theis solution to the second branch.
 As was said earlier, the resistance of the overlying layer does not determine
 the position of the two bounding Theis curves; it only determines the height
 of the horizontal branch of the curves where they transfer from the elastic
 to the specify yield Theis curve.

\end_inset

 m, in the top of the overlying layer and in all 35 model layers of the
 aquifer.
 First of all, one sees that the head difference between the top and the
 bottom of the aquifer can be neglected; only the model with the low resistance
 shows a small difference.
 This is because in that case the the vertical velocities in the aquifer
 are large enough to cause a small head loss between the top and the bottom
 of the aquifer (notice that 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{z}=k_{r}=10\,\mathrm{m/d}$
\end_inset

 was used).
 Again, one observes that the horizontal branch climbs with reduced 
\begin_inset Formula $r/\lambda$
\end_inset

 between the four models.
 The blue line is the drawdown in the top of the overlying layer, i.e.
 that of the water table itself.
 This blue line thus reveals the emptying of the top layer due to the downward
 leakage invoked by the drawdown in the pumped aquifer below.

\begin_layout Subsection
The two Theis bounding curves
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was explained before that position of the two bounding Theis curves only
 depend on their respective storage coefficients and not on the resistance
 of the covering layer.
 Notice that we have for the two Theis curves
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1}{u_{1}}=\frac{4kD}{S}\frac{t}{r^{2}}\mbox{ and }\,\frac{1}{u_{2}}=\frac{4kD}{S_{y}}\frac{t}{r^{2}}
\]

\end_inset

Hence, the horizontal axes of both Theis curves only differ in their storage
 coefficient.
 And so
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{u_{2}}{u_{1}}=\frac{S_{y}}{S}
\]

\end_inset

Hence the horizontal axis of the specific-yield Theis curve is the one of
 the elastic-storage Theis curve multiplied by 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{y}/S$
\end_inset

.
 On the logarithmic scale this is a horizontal shift.
 Because we have chosen values 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{y}/S$
\end_inset

=100, the second Theis curve is shifted over exactly two log-cycles to the
 right of the first, elastic-storage Theis curve, which can be verified
 immediately in the graphs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This also implies the following for the determination of the specific yield
 from a pumping test that shows a clear delayed-yield behavior.
 Simply determine the horizontal shift of the second with respect to the
 first Theis curve, which is factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, and then apply 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{y}=\tau S$

\begin_layout Subsection
Influence of partial penetration of the well screen
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It should be clear that partial penetration causes the drawdown near the
 well screen to become larger than the Theis drawdown predicts.
 Hence, one should first correct piezometers closer than about 1D from the
 well for partial penetration (see section on partial penetration) before
 analyzing any pumping test.
 This is illustrated in figure  
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Effect-of-partial-on-delayed-yield"

\end_inset

.
 It shows the drawdown in the top (cyan) and bottom (magenta) of the aquifer
 for a nearby point ( 
\begin_inset Formula $r=9$
\end_inset

 m, thick lines) and a distant point ( 
\begin_inset Formula $r=90$
\end_inset

 m, thin lines).
 The figure s show that at a point at a large distance from the well is
 not influenced by partial penetration, as the darwdown in the top and bottom
 of the aquifer are practically the same and the curves stay between the
 Theis envelopes, which are the same as in the cases with fully penetrating
 screens.
 However, a point close to the well, i.e.
 less than about 1 to 1.5 aquifer thicknesses away, may experience a serious
 deviation caused by partial penetration.
 The point opposite the well screen at the top of the aquifer (thick cyan
 line) has a drawdown that is larger than that for a fully penetrating screen;
 the point at the same distance but at the bottom of the aquifer (far below
 the screen, thick magenta line) has a much lower drawdown than would be
 the case with a fully penetrating screen.
 Moreover, these differences do not disappear with time.
 On the other hand, if we correct for partial penetration by subtracting
 the effect from all measurements, we regain the fully penetrating drawdowns,
 which are then directly amenable to interpretation using the standard solutions
 of Theis and Hantush.

Large-diameter wells (not for the exam)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The solution of Theis for transient flow in an unbounded confined or unconfined
 aquifer is based on the assumption that the storage inside the well casing
 can be neglected.
 While this is generally a valid assumption for tube wells, and, therefore,
 for wells in semi-confined and confined aquifers, it may not hold in unconfined
 aquifers when large-diameter dug wells are used, such as the one shown
 in figure  44, which is a picture of a large open well in India.
 Especially when the transmissivity of the aquifer is low, the storage in
 a large diameter well represents a large portion of the water extracted,
 at least on the short run, and will thus have a substantial influence on
 the drawdown.
 This influence must be taken into account when interpreting drawdown tests
 on such wells.
 It should be clear that the formula for a large-diameter well will also
 hold true when pumping water from a pond.

 well.
 The partial differential equation upon which it is based is the same as

 However, the boundary condition at the well face differs; the extraction
 must now match both the inflow from the aquifer and the drawdown inside
 the well casing.
 It thus becomes

Convolution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
What convolution is and how it works
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Convolution is applied in many branches of science.
 Because it is so widely and flexibly applicable, it is important to have
 a thorough understanding of it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Convolution is a general principle that can be seen as smart superposition,
 which allows for efficient simulation of linear systems with arbitrary
 time (or space) varying inputs.
 In dealing with groundwater it allows interpreting pumping tests with arbitrari
ly varying extractions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Olsthoorn2008"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 It further allows simulation of the groundwater head due to arbitrarily
 varying river stages as well has groundwater head fluctuations as a function
 of varying recharge.
 It is also heavily used in time-series analysis.
 In mathematical course books, convolution is mostly explained in connection
 with the Laplace transform, which has some advantages in dealing with it
 mathematically.
 However, it is not necessary to understand or apply it.
 So we do not need this here.
 In the end convolution boils down to a moving weighted average of the past
 input data, in which the weight are the response to a unit pulse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The essential condition for convolution to work is that the response of
 the system in question due to some physical pulse is unique and proportional
 to the magnitude of that pulse.
 A short rain shower is an example of such a pulse due to which the groundwater
 level will respond by first rising and subsequently declining until the
 effect of the shower has completely disappeared.
 The reaction of the system in question to a pulse of unit magnitude is
 called the impulse response 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{IR}\left(\tau\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The impulse response depends only on 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 the time 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{0}$
\end_inset

 since the pulse took place, hence 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=t-t_{0}$
\end_inset

 (see figure  
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Impulse-response"

\end_inset

).
 Notice that the dimension of the pulse (in this case 1 mm of rain for instance)
 may be completely different from the dimension of the reaction of the system
 (change of head or change of flow for instance).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can subdivide any arbitrary time-input into a series of subsequent pulses,
 for instance, daily rain figure s can be seen as such a continuous input
 as well as a series of rain pulses.
 But also a time-varying pumping rate or river stage, can be regarded as
 a series of hourly or daily pulses.
 If one imagines an infinite series of unit pulses glued together, say after
 
\begin_inset Formula $t=t_{0}$
\end_inset

, then for 
\begin_inset Formula $t>t_{0}$
\end_inset

 we have a continuous unit input (a unit input that is an input with the
 value equal to 1, like 1 mm/d continuous rain).
 The response of the system to such a continuous unit input after 
\begin_inset Formula $t=t_{0}$
\end_inset

 is called the step response, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{SR}\left(\tau\right)$
\end_inset

.
 In our example this could mean that the well starts pumping at a rate 
\begin_inset Formula $Q=1$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $t=t_{0}$
\end_inset

 and it keeps pumping with this rate forever.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that most analytic solutions of groundwater flow are, in fact, step
 responses.
 For instance, the solution for the change of groundwater head or discharge
 due to a sudden change of the water level of the river, i.e.
 the expression 
\begin_inset Formula $s\left(x,t\right)=A\,\mathtt{erfc}\left(u\right)\mbox{, with }u=\sqrt{x^{2}S/\left(4kDt\right)}$
\end_inset

 is such an example.
 The same is true for the Theis and the Hantush solutions, they too assume
 a sudden change from zero to a fixed extraction at 
\begin_inset Formula $t=0$
\end_inset

, which remains forever constant thereafter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because the step response can be regarded as the response due to an infinite
 number of unit pulses for 
\begin_inset Formula $t>t_{0}$
\end_inset

, it immediately follows that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mbox{SR}\left(\tau\right) & = & \intop_{t=0}^{t}\mbox{IR}\left(\nu\right)d\nu\\
\mbox{IR} & = & \frac{\partial\,\mathrm{SR}\left(\tau\right)}{\partial\tau}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In practice, we deal with pulses that have a given duration, such as the
 rainfall during one day.
 Of course, the rain will vary during the day, but in the end we may not
 possess data on a shorter time scale than one day, and, therefore, the
 daily rainfall may be the best and most detailed data that we than obtain
 in a given case.
 We will then probably treat these figure s as the average rainfall for
 each day as the best approximation of the time-varying precipitation.
 Of course, if one has hourly data, one may use these data as average values
 for each hour as the best approximation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So in general, we will have a series of figure s for daily (or hourly, weekly
 or monthly) precipitation, evapotranspiration, river stage, extraction
 rate etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We then need the so-called block response 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{BR}\left(\tau,\Delta\tau\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The bock response is the result of a sudden change of an input variable,
 for instance rain, with a unit magnitude, that is constant during a given
 time 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau$
\end_inset

 and zero thereafter.
 It's the result of a unit pulse of fixed duration.
 The easiest way to compute the block response is by superposition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{BR}\left(\tau,\Delta\tau\right)=\mbox{SR}\left(\tau\right)-\mbox{SR}\left(\tau-\Delta\tau\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which is what we have been doing by our superposition.
 For instance, with a well in an groundwater system of infinite extent,
 that fulfills the presumptions underlying the Theis solution, we may write
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\mbox{BR}\left(\tau,\Delta\tau\right) & = & 0\mbox{, for }\tau\le0\\
\mbox{BR}\left(\tau,\Delta\tau\right) & = & \frac{1}{4\pi kD}\mbox{W}\left(\frac{r^{2}S}{4kD\tau}\right)\mbox{, for }0<\tau\le\Delta\tau\ \\
\mbox{BR}\left(\tau,\Delta\tau\right) & = & \frac{1}{4\pi kD}\left[\mbox{W}\left(\frac{r^{2}S}{4kD\tau}\right)-\mbox{W}\left(\frac{r^{2}S}{4kD\left(\tau-\Delta\tau\right)}\right)\right]\mbox{, for }\tau>\Delta\tau\label{eq:block-response}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on the previous superposition we can readily compute the required
 response of the system using the standard groundwater solutions.

Figure  
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:The-effect-of-a-series-of-pulses"

\end_inset

 shows how standard superposition would work once we have the block response
 as explained above.
 For every subsequent actual input pulse of, let's say a day, we would have
 multiply the block response and with the actual magnitude of the input
 to obtain its true response, shown as the set of black curves in figure

 Each such system reaction, i.e.
 each curve, would have to be shifted down the time axis time in accordance
 with the moment that the pulse occurred, and finally all these reaction
 curves have to be superimposed to obtain the combined reaction of the system
 at the desired time.
 This procedure is what we actually do with superposition and is illustrated

Convolution as a smart way of doing this superposition; it takes a different
 perspective, one that is illustrated in figure  
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Turning-the-impulse-around"

\end_inset

: the essence is that it turns the system response around.
 Let's see how that works.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a fixed point in time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, which is a time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 after the pulse.
 The top image shows this pulse, its reaction, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{IR}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 or the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{BR}\left(\tau,\Delta\tau\right)$
\end_inset

.
 It also shows the considered time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, which is indicated by the vertical line connecting the two graphs.
 The impact of the pulse at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t-\tau$
\end_inset

 on the system at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is the pulse or block response for 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 multiplied by the actual height of the pulse, 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
 Hence the result 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 of the pulse is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
s=p\left(t-\tau\right)\mbox{IR}\left(\tau\right)\label{eq:result-of-a-ipulse-at-time-t-tau}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

as indicated in the top figure .
 Read this formula as the
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

result of the pulse at t equals the impulse response 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{IR}\left(\tau\right)$
\end_inset

 multiplied by the magnitude of the pulse at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t-\tau$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 at 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 days ago.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But this is identical with what we get in the bottom figure , where the
 impulse response is taken relative to 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 itself and is reversed in time.
 Taking this perspective, we would say:
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the effect of a pulse at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t-\tau$
\end_inset

 (or
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

a time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 ago
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) equals the reversed impulse response at 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{IR}\left(\tau\right)$
\end_inset

 times the height of the pulse at 
\begin_inset Formula $t-\tau$
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 This is exactly the same as equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

The read bar shows the response of the system 30 days after its pulse.
 It equals the size of the pulse times the block response.
 Because the value of the pulse in the top figure is 7, the length of the
 red bar in the bottom figure , which is the system response, therefore
 equals 7 times the length of height of the blue block-response.
 The magenta line is the block-response but inverted in time, so that it
 looks backward.
 The distance between the pulse at 
\begin_inset Formula $t=0$
\end_inset

 and the focus time 
\begin_inset Formula $t=30$
\end_inset

 is the same for both the original and the reverse block response.
 Thus, to get the system's response at 
\begin_inset Formula $t=30$
\end_inset

 d, just multiply the value of the block-response at the time of the pulse
 with that pulse.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But this is true the effect at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 now of any pulse in the past.
 There is no need to shift the reversed curve at all.
 So with this perspective, the only thing we have to do to compute the result
 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 due to all inputs of the past, i.e.
 for time 
\begin_inset Formula $-\infty<time<t$
\end_inset

, is to multiply each pulse happening a time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 ago, that is at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t-\tau$
\end_inset

 by the value of the impulse response at 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

.
 This is illustrated in figure  
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Convolution-is-the-multiplication-of"

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

.
 If we compare this procedure with the basic superposition shown in figure
  
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:The-effect-of-a-series-of-pulses"

\end_inset

, we see that, to compute the state of the system at any given point of
 time due to what happened in the past, requires only one reversed impulse
 response, which has to be multiplied with the corresponding the past input
 (such as rain, river stage or flow rate).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mathematically this can be generalized as follows
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
h=\intop_{\tau=0}^{\infty}\mbox{IR}\left(\tau\right)\,p\left(t-\tau\right)d\tau\label{eq:convolution-continuous}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the input 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is continuous.
 In the case we split up the past in discrete steps of length 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau$
\end_inset

 for which we the average intensity (daily values, say), we use the block
 response for the corresponding step length 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau$
\end_inset

.
 Then we have
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
h=\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\mbox{BR}\left(\tau,\Delta\tau\right)p_{t-\tau_{i}-\Delta\tau\rightarrow t-\tau_{i}}\label{eq:convolution-discrete}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{t-\tau_{i}-\Delta\tau\rightarrow t-\tau_{i}}$
\end_inset

 means the intensity of the input between 
\begin_inset Formula $t-\tau_{i}-\Delta\tau$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t-\tau_{i}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{BR}\left(\tau,\Delta\tau\right)$
\end_inset

 as defined in equation  
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:block-response"

\end_inset

.
 This procedure is called convolution.
 It is continuous when we work with the impulse response or discrete in
 case we work with the block response, what we'll always do in practice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Final note: Mathematicians mostly take the integral in equation

\begin_inset Formula $-\infty<\tau<\infty$

, because the

Arbitrarily fluctuating river stage

\begin_layout Standard
We can readily carry out a convolution in a spreadsheet or in Python.
 Python is more straightforward and flexible, therefore we'll use Python.
 To do convolution, we need input data, like a time series of the river
 water level and the impulse response (instantaneous pulse of zero-length
 but with given magnitude equal to 1) or block response block response (a
 pulse of of intensity 1 during a fixed time 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau$
\end_inset

), i.e.
 the river level rises suddenly by 1 m and and falls again by 1 m after
 time 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau$
\end_inset

, which will be the length of our time step.
 Working with the block response is easiest to comprehend, so we'll use
 that.
 When we have both the input and the block response, we have to carry out
 the convolution.
 The convolution for one time 
\emph on
t
\emph default
 is the past input up to time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, weighted by the block response reversed in time, that is we multiply the
 input at 
\begin_inset Formula $t-\tau$
\end_inset

 with the block-response value for 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

.
 Both the past input and the block response are entire arrays.
 So, the input array up to time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is multiplied by the block-response array reversed in time to get the effect
 of all past input at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 This is for one point in time, 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 To get the result of the convolution for all times, we have to repeat this
 procedure for all times.
 What you notice, is, that convolution is in essence a moving weighted average
 of the input.
 The input is weighted by the reversed block response and for each time.

In mathematics, convolution is a standard procedure.
 Many engineering problems are solved through it.
 Single processing engineers use it all the time to analyze signals.
 Also in hydrology, convolution is used to analyze time hydrological time

 We could do without using the average value, but than it takes a run-in
 period to get rid of the start-value, which is zero by default.
 The length of the run-in period is equal to the length of the block response.
 In the current situation, this response is reasonable short, but in other
 situations that might not be the case, for instance with Theis wells that
 will never reach equilibrium.
 We'll handle a Theis case hereafter.

\begin_layout Subsection
Impulse response, block response, and step response comparison
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us now illustrate the difference between impulse response and block
 response, also for the river stage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The block response of the river stage is given in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:block-response-river-stage"

\end_inset

, while the step response is the known solution itself:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{SR}\left(\tau\right)=\mathrm{erfc}\left(\sqrt{\frac{x^{2}S}{4kD\tau}}\right)
\]

\end_inset

The impulse response is obtained by differentiation of the step response
 with respect to time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\mbox{IR}\left(\tau\right) & = & \frac{\partial}{\partial\tau}\left\{ \mathrm{erfc}\left(\sqrt{\frac{x^{2}S}{4kD\tau}}\right)\right\} \label{eq:analytical-impuse-response}\\
 & = & \frac{\partial}{\partial\tau}\left(\intop_{u}^{\infty}\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}e^{-\nu^{2}}d\nu\right)\mbox{, with }u=\sqrt{\frac{x^{2}S}{4kD\tau}}\\
 & = & -\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}e^{-u^{2}}\frac{\partial u}{\partial\tau}\\
 & = & -\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}e^{-u^{2}}\left(-\frac{1}{2\tau\sqrt{\tau}}\sqrt{\frac{x^{2}S}{4kD}}\right)\\
 & = & \frac{\sqrt{\frac{x^{2}S}{4kD\tau}}}{\tau\sqrt{\pi}}e^{-u^{2}}\\
 & = & \frac{u}{\tau\sqrt{\pi}}e^{-u^{2}}\nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that time is embedded in 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

.
 For small step widths 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau$
\end_inset

, the values of the block response almost equal those of the impulse response
 when multiplied by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau$
\end_inset

,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{BR}\left(\tau,\Delta\tau\right)\approx\mbox{IR}\left(\tau\right)\Delta\tau
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This should be obvious because the content of the block response is its
 intensity, which is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 spread over the duration of the block, which is 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau$
\end_inset

, while the impulse response is a pulse of zero duration but of total contents
 equal to 1.
 Hence, the numerical value of the block response is 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau$
\end_inset

, which is also the value of the impulse response multiplied by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau$
\end_inset

.
 This is also obvious mathematically,

\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau\gg\Delta\tau$
\end_inset

 the difference disappears.
 This is illustrated in figure  
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Block-response-and-analutical-impulsre-response-graph"

\end_inset

.
 The two responses are virtually identical except for smaller 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 and especially for 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau<\Delta\tau$
\end_inset

, but this does not affect practical use of either.
 In practice, I prefer to always use the block response as it is exact and
 always obtainable from the given step response by a simple subtraction.

 For this first get a time array.
 In this case we take days starting in the past, 350 days ago or 350 days
 before a given date.
 Then generate an array of random values between 0 and 1.
 The length of the array is the same as that of the array of times.
 Subtract 0.5 to get values between -0.5 and 0.5.
 Filter using a moving average of length 25, to smooth the data somewhat.
 Finally multiply by Q0 to get a time-varying extraction that covers the
 entire simulation period.

 The factor

.
 The large the memory of the groundwater system, the longer the past period
 over which the recharge is integrated and has an effect on on the head.
 Because the average recharge in this example (Dutch data) is positive,
 a large system must show heads that are always above its boundaries (zero).
 This is indeed the case in the third picture, and more so for points farther
 away from the boundaries, i.e.
 more to the center line of the basin.
 The shorter the system memory, the more often a dry period can cause the
 heads to fall below the water levels of bounding canals or rivers.
 Also, the shorter the memory the lower will the average head be relative
 to the bounding surface water level.
 This simulation is realistic, except for the fact that it was assumed that
 the water from a recharge pulse reaches the groundwater immediately.
 While this may be a good approximation for shallow groundwater, it is not
 realistic where the water table is 10 m or more below ground surface.
 In such situations, it may take several months before a recharge pulse
 causes the flow from the unsaturated zone into the saturated zone to increase.
 A thick unsaturated zone causes the recharge arrival in the saturated zone
 to be delayed and somewhat smoothed.
 If this delay and smoothing can be estimated from an unsaturated zone analyses
 of from measurements, it may be included by filtering the recharge time
 series before using it has input for the head simulation.
 Filtering is just a moving averaging procedure, hence a convolution, which
 can be carried out with the same function 
\emph on
lfilter(...)
\emph default
, all we need is a block response that relates the recharge to the flux
 at the bottom of the unsaturated zone.

 we already know.

 by looking up the result in a Laplace transform table (
