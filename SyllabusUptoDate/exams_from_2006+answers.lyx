Well adjacent to a straight fully penetrating river.
 The aquifer is homogeneous and extends to infinity.This is clearly a well

 solution is applicable.
 To obtain values for the Theis well function, you can make use of the Theis

\begin_layout Standard
But we must take care of the river, which creates a fixed-head boundary
 condition.
 This is done by placing a mirror well of opposite sign at the exact opposite
 side of the river and at the same distance.
 The formula for the well and its mirror well is

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s_{r,t}=\frac{Q}{4\pi kD}\left(\mathrm{W}\left(\frac{r_{1}^{2}S}{4kDt}\right)-\mathrm{W}\left(\frac{r_{2}^{2}S}{4kDt}\right)\right)

, Then read the values for

 from the Theis type graph, which yields the following numbers (however
 yours may be a bit different because it's difficult to read exact numbers
 from a graph.

\begin_layout Standard
The actual drawdown after 14 days will be that of continuous pumpoing (0.31
 m) minus that of 7 days continuous pumping (0.28 m) because the pump was
 switched off after 7 days.
 We, therefore, after 14 days we only have a remaining drawdown equal to
 0.31 – 0.28 = 0.03 m.

 If the barometer pressure increases with the equivalent of 40 cm water

A loading efficiency of 60% implies that 60 % of the load at ground surface
 will be supported by the water.
 Hence a loading at ground surface by the barometer, which also exercises
 100% at the water level in the piezometer will cause a decline of the head
 in the piezometer by 40% of the load, which, in this case is 40% of 40

In the Theis situation all extracted water is released from storage and
 from storage only, while in the Hantush situation it also originates from
 the leakage through a top or bottom aquitard induced by the drawdown.
 The Theis drawdown, whether due to pumping a confined or an unconfined
 aquifer will never reach equilibrium.
 However a Hantush drawdown will reach equilibrium because the induced flow
 through the aquitard is proportional to the local induced head difference
 and therefore will eventually balance the extraction.

\begin_layout Standard
A barometer efficiency of 25% implies a loading efficiency of 75%, i.e., that
 75% of the load increment on ground surface is carried by the water and
 the remaining 25% by the soil skeleton.
 The increase of the pressure by 75% due to a load means a water table rise
 of 75% in the piezometer, however because it is the barometer that causes
 the load increase, the full 100% of the barometer pressure increase works
 on the water surface in the piezometer, so that the net effect for the
 water level is 75% up + 100% down = 25% down in the piezometer.

\begin_layout Standard
Delayed yield stems from delayed drawdown due to unconfined storage that
 manifests itself after the drawdown due to elastic, which is must faster
 due to the elastic storage coefficient that is about two orders of magnitude
 smaller than the phreatic storage or specific yield.
 Delayed yield may be encountered both in a phreatic aquifer and in semi-confine
d aquifers with an overlaying phreatic water table than cannot be maintained
 when it is affected by downward leakage into the pumped semi-confined aquifer
 below.

Animal holes stay dry if the zone they are in is unsaturated, which means
 that the pore pressure is negative, i.e., below the atmospheric pressure
 in the animal holes.
 Hence animals are not affected by rain, they are only affected when the
 water table rises above their bottom and the pore pressure becomes zero
 or positive.
 In that case the holes may collapse, as they become filled up with water
 and the animals are driven out of their homes.

A water level in a piezometer in a confined aquifer is affected if the weight

\begin_layout Standard
Although the water pressure in increased by the same amount in both cases,
 the water level in the piezometer goes down in the case of the increased
 barometric pressure, because the air pressure works for 100% on the water
 level inside the piezometer which is greater than the increase of water
 pressure in the aquifer due to the air pressure on ground surface.
 In the case of an increased load there is no increase of pressure on the
 water level in the piezometer, and so the change of water level in the
 piezometer fully reflects the change of water pressure in the aquifer,
 which is some fraction of the increase of pressure on ground surface.

\end_layout

 The drawdown is measured over a number of days at an observation well at

The drawdown difference per log cycle is the most convenient way to compute
 the transmissivity.
 First draw a line through the straight portion of the graph (see figure

 0.32 m.
 Then with log(10)=1, compute the transmissivity from
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s_{10t}-s_{t}\approx\frac{2.3Q}{4\pi kD}\rightarrow kD=\frac{2.3Q}{4\pi\left(s_{10t}-s_{t}\right)}=\frac{1.3\times800}{4\pi0.32}\approx460\,\mathrm{m/d}

 This causes the head to change in the strip.
 At the right hand side the water level is unchanged.

 We want to use this expression to computed the head in the strip.

The long-term drawdown in a confined aquifer due to a well pumping from

 A practical approximation of the area of influence is where this approximation
 of the Theis solution, hence, the linear drawdown on half-log paper is
 zero.
 This is mathematically done by setting the argument of the log equal to
 1.

 should also provide the curve with a specific value of
